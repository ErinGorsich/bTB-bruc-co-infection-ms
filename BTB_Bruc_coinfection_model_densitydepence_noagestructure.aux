The inset figure shows the distribution of ages in our sample, which best cover buffalo between two and eight years old and include 796 samples from 151 repeatedly captured individuals. Ages are binned for visualization and animals that test positive are assumed to remain positive for the duration of the study. Sample sizes for TB- are: 10, 182, 209, 103, 27, 35 buffalo. Sample sizes for TB+ animals are: 0, 21, 108, 75, 21, 1 for ages 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10, and 10+ respectively.}}{2}}

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces Diagram of model structure and assumptions. We model bTB infection as a directly transmitted, lifelong infection (Bengis 1999). We model brucellosis infection as a persistent infection, by allowing animals to recrudesce and transmit the infection. Buffalo populations experience logistic growth with density dependence in births rates that are independent of disease and for a fixed carrying capacity, K (Gao and Hethcote 1992). Transmission of both infections are assumed to be density dependent.}}{3}}
