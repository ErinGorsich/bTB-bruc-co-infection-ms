@article{randall_endemic_2013,
	Abstract = {Endemic, low-virulence parasitic infections are common in nature. Such infections may deplete host resources, which in turn could affect the reproduction of other parasites during co-infection. We aimed to determine whether the reproduction, and therefore transmission potential, of an epidemic parasite was limited by energy costs imposed on the host by an endemic infection. Total lipids, triacylglycerols (TAG) and polar lipids were measured in cockroaches (Blattella germanica) that were fed ad libitum, starved or infected with an endemic parasite, Gregarina blattarum. Reproductive output of an epidemic parasite, Steinernema carpocapsae, was then assessed by counting the number of infective stages emerging from these three host groups. We found both starvation and gregarine infection reduced cockroach lipids, mainly through depletion of TAG. Further, both starvation and G. blattarum infection resulted in reduced emergence of nematode transmission stages. This is, to our knowledge, the first study to demonstrate directly that host resource depletion caused by endemic infection could affect epidemic disease transmission. In view of the ubiquity of endemic infections in nature, future studies of epidemic transmission should take greater account of endemic co-infections},

@article{jones_global_2008,
	Abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are a significant burden on global economies and public health1--3. Their emergence is thought to be driven largely by socio-economic, environmental and eco- logical factors1--9, but no comparative study has explicitly analysed these linkages to understand global temporal and spatial patterns of EIDs. Here we analyse a database of 335 EID `events' (origins of EIDs) between 1940 and 2004, and demonstrate non-random glo- bal patterns. EID events have risen significantly over time after controlling for reporting bias, with their peak incidence (in the 1980s) concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are domi- nated by zoonoses (60.3\% of EIDs): the majority of these (71.8\%) originate in wildlife (for example, severe acute respiratory virus, Ebola virus), and are increasing significantly over time. We find that 54.3\% of EID events are caused by bacteria or rickettsia, reflecting a large number of drug-resistant microbes in our data- base. Our results confirm that EID origins are significantly corre- lated with socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors, and provide a basis for identifying regions where new EIDs are most likely to originate (emerging disease `hotspots'). They also reveal a substantial risk of wildlife zoonotic and vector-borne EIDs originating at lower latitudes where reporting effort is low. We conclude that global resources to counter disease emergence are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and surveil- lance effort focused on countries from where the next important EID is least likely to originate.},

@article{pedersen_infectious_2007,
	Abstract = {Parasite-driven declines in wildlife have become increasingly common and can pose significant risks to natural populations. We used the IUCN Red List of Threatened and Endangered Species and compiled data on hosts threatened by infectious disease and their parasites to better understand the role of infectious disease in contemporary host extinctions. The majority of mammal species considered threatened by parasites were either carnivores or artiodactyls, two clades that include the majority of domesticated animals. Parasites affecting host threat status were predominantly viruses and bacteria that infect a wide range of host species, including domesticated animals. Counter to our predictions, parasites transmitted by close contact were more likely to cause extinction risk than those transmitted by other routes. Mammal species threatened by parasites were not better studied for infectious diseases than other threatened mammals and did not have more parasites or differ in four key traits demonstrated to affect parasite species richness in other comparative studies. Our findings underscore the need for better information concerning the distribution and impacts of infectious diseases in populations of endangered mammals. In addition, our results suggest that evolutionary similarity to domesticated animals may be a key factor associated with parasite-mediated declines; thus, efforts to limit contact between domesticated hosts and wildlife could reduce extinction risk.},

@article{james_o._lloyd-smith_superspreading_2005,
	Abstract = {Population-level analyses often use average quantities to describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does not arise from identifiable groups1,2. A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic repro- ductive number, R0, which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population3,4. Population estimates of R0 can obscure consider- able individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by numerous `superspreading events' in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases5--10. For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empiri- cally, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear2,10,11. Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distri- bution of individual infectiousness around R0 is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform population- wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indi- cate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency.},

@article{mccallum_transmission_2009,
	Abstract = {Most pathogens threatening to cause extinction of a host species are maintained on one or more reservoir hosts, in addition to the species that is threatened by disease. Further, most conventional host--pathogen theory assumes that transmission is related to host density, and therefore a pathogen should become extinct before its sole host. Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease is a recently emerged infectious cancer that has led to massive population declines and grave concerns for the future persistence of this largest surviving marsupial carnivore. Here we report the results of mark--recapture studies at six sites and use these data to estimate epidemiological parameters critical to both accurately assessing the risk of extinction from this disease and effectively managing this disease threat. Three sites were monitored from before or close to the time of disease arrival, and at three others disease was well established when trapping began, in one site for at least 10 years. We found no evidence for sex-specific differences in disease prevalence and little evidence of consistent seasonal variation in the force of infection. At all sites, the disease was maintained at high levels of prevalence (.50\% in 2--3-year-old animals), despite causing major population declines. We also provide the first estimates of the basic reproductive rate R0 for this disease. Using a simple age-structured deterministic model, we show that our results are not consistent with transmission being proportional to the density of infected hosts but are consistent with frequency-dependent transmission. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that local disease prevalence in 2--3-year-olds still exceeds 50\% at a site where population density has been reduced by up to 90\% in the past 12 years. These findings lend considerable weight to concerns that this host-specific pathogen will cause the extinction of the Tasmanian devil. Our study highlights the importance of rapidly implementing monitoring programs to determine how transmission depends on host density and emphasizes the need for ongoing management strategies involving a disease-free ``insurance population,'' along with ongoing field monitoring programs to confirm whether local population extinction occurs.},

@article{mccallum_disease_2012,
	Abstract = {Invading infectious diseases can, in theory, lead to the extinction of host populations, particularly if reservoir species are present or if disease transmission is frequency-dependent. The number of historic or prehistoric extinctions that can unequivocally be attributed to infectious disease is relatively small, but gathering firm evidence in retrospect is extremely difficult. Amphibian chytridiomycosis and Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) are two very different infectious diseases that are currently threatening to cause extinctions in Australia. These provide an unusual opportunity to investigate the processes of disease-induced extinction and possible management strategies. Both diseases are apparently recent in origin. Tasmanian DFTD is entirely host-specific but potentially able to cause extinction because transmission depends weakly, if at all, on host density. Amphibian chytridiomycosis has a broad host range but is highly pathogenic only to some populations of some species. At present, both diseases can only be managed by attempting to isolate individuals or populations from disease. Management options to accelerate the process of evolution of host resistance or tolerance are being investigated in both cases. Anthropogenic changes including movement of diseases and hosts, habitat destruction and fragmentation and climate change are likely to increase emerging disease threats to biodiversity and it is critical to further develop strategies to manage these threats.},

in animals or else originated in nonhuman hosts. Influenza, plague, and trypanosomiasis are classic examples of zoonotic infections that transmit from animals to humans. The multihost ecology of zoonoses leads to complex dynamics, and analytical tools, such as mathematical modeling, are vital to the development of effective control policies and research agendas. Much attention has focused on modeling pathogens with simpler life cycles and immediate global urgency, such as influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Meanwhile, vector-transmitted, chronic, and protozoan infections have been neglected, as have crucial processes such as cross-species transmission. Progress in understanding and combating zoonoses requires a new generation of models that addresses a broader set of pathogen life histories and integrates across host species and scientific disciplines.},

@article{woolhouse_heterogeneities_1997,
	Abstract = {Previous theoretical studies have suggested that heterogeneities in transmission rates can have significant effects on the epidemiology of parasite infections. However, the magnitude of these effects in practice remains uncertain because of the difficulty of quantifying such heterogeneities under natural conditions. In this paper we consider the effects of heterogeneous rates of contact with infective water bodies on the basic reproductive rate, Ro, of human schistosomes. In particular, we examine the theoretical effects of differences in the distribution of contacts among individuals and among sites. We find that an individual's contribution to Rodepends not only on the net contact rate but also on how these contacts are distributed among sites - the contact pattern. Our analysis of field data suggests a substantial impact of heterogeneous contact rates on Ro in practice. Significant reductions in Ro may be possible if schistosomiasis control efforts are targeted at certain sites and, especially, certain individuals.},

@article{anderson_aic_1994,
	Abstract = {Selection of a proper model as a basis for statistical inference from capture-recapture data is critical. This is especially so when using open models in the analysis of multiple, interrelated data sets (e.g., males and females, with 2-3 age classes, over 3-5 areas and 10-15 yr). The most general model considered for such data sets might contain 1000 survival and recapture parameters. This paper presents numerical results on three information-theoretic methods for model selection when the data are overdispersed (i.e., a lack of independence so that extra-binomial variation occurs). Akaike's information criterion (AIC), a second-order adjustment to AIC for bias (AIC(c)), and a dimension-consistent criterion (CAIC) were modified using an empirical estimate of the average overdispersion, based on quasi-likelihood theory. Quality of model selection was evaluated based on the Euclidian distance between standardized {\textless}(theta)over cap{\textgreater} and theta (parameter theta is vector valued); this quantity (a type of residual sum of squares, hence denoted as RSS) is a combination of squared bias and variance. Five results seem to be of general interest for these product-multinomial models. First, when there was overdispersion the most direct estimator of the variance inflation factor was positively biased and the relative bias increased with the amount of overdispersion. Second, AIC and AIC(c), unadjusted for overdispersion using quasi-likelihood theory, performed poorly in selecting a model with a small RSS value when the data were overdispersed (i.e., overfitted models were selected when compared to the model with the minimum RRS value). Third, the information-theoretic criteria, adjusted for overdispersion, performed well, selected parismonious models, and had a good balance between under- and overfitting the data. Fourth, generally, the dimension-consistent criterion selected models with fewer parameters than the other criteria, had smaller RSS values, but clearly was in error by underfitting when compared with the model with the minimum RSS value. Fifth, even if the true model structure (but not the actual parameter values in the model) is known, that true model, when fitted to the data (by parameter estimation) is a relatively poor basis for statistical inference when that true model includes several, let alone many, estimated parameters that are not significantly different from O.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the ecological factors driving the burden and pathogenicity of parasites is chal- lenging. Indeed, the dynamics of host--parasite interactions is driven by factors organized across nested hierarchical levels (e.g. hosts, localities), and indirect effects are expected owing to inter- actions between levels.
2. In this study, we combined Bayesian multilevel models, path analyses and a model selection procedure to account for these complexities and to decipher the relative effects of host- and envi- ronment-related factors on the burden and the pathogenicity of an ectoparasite (Tracheliastes polycolpus) on its fish host (Leuciscus leuciscus). We also tested the year-to-year consistency of the relationships linking these factors to the burden and the pathogenic effects of T. polycolpus.
3. We found significant relationships between the parasite burden and host-related factors: body length and age were positively related to parasite burden and heterozygous hosts displayed a higher parasite burden. In contrast, both host- and environment-related factors were linked to pathogenic effects. Pathogenicity was correlated negatively with host body length and positively with age; this illustrates that some factors (e.g. body length) showed inverse relationships with parasite burden and pathogenicity. Pathogenic effects were stronger in cooler upstream sites and where host den- sity was lower. Path analyses revealed that these relationships between environment-related factors and pathogenic effects were direct and were not indirect relationships mediated by the host charac- teristics. Finally, we found that the strength and the shape of certain relationships were consistent across years, while they were clearly not for some others.
4. Our study illustrates that considering conjointly causal relationships among factors and the hierarchical structure of host--parasite interactions is appropriate for dissecting the complex links between hosts, parasites and their common environment.},

	Abstract = {1. Identifying general patterns of how and why survival rates vary across space and time is neces- sary to truly understand population dynamics of a species. However, this is not an easy task given the complexity and interactions of processes involved, and the interpopulation differences in main survival determinants.
2. Here, using European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) as a model and information from local studies, we investigated whether we could make inferences about trends and drivers of survival of a species that are generalizable to large spatio-temporal scales. To do this, we first focused on overall survival and then examined cause-specific mortalities, mainly predation and diseases, which may lead to those patterns.
3. Ourresultsshowthatwithinthelarge-scalevariabilityinrabbitsurvival,thereexistgeneralpat- terns that are explained by the integration of factors previously known to be important at the local level (i.e. age, climate, diseases, predation or density dependence). We found that both inter- and intrastudy survival rates increased in magnitude and decreased in variability as rabbits grow old, although this tendency was less pronounced in populations with epidemic diseases. Some causes leading to these higher mortalities in young rabbits could be the stronger effect of rainfall at those ages, as well as, other death sources like malnutrition or infanticide.
4. Predation is also greater for newborns and juveniles, especially in population without diseases. Apart from the effect of diseases, predation patterns also depended on factors, such as, density, season, and type and density of predators. Finally, we observed that infectious diseases also showed general relationships with climate, breeding (i.e. new susceptible rabbits) and age, although the association type varied between myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease.
5. Inconclusion,large-scalepatternsofspatio-temporalvariabilityinrabbitsurvivalemergefrom the combination of different factors that interrelate both directly and through density dependence. This highlights the importance of performing more comprehensive studies to reveal combined effects and complex relationships that help us to better understand the mechanisms underlying population dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a phenomenon in which viral replication is increased rather than decreased by immune sera, has been observed in vitro for a large number of viruses of public health importance, including flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and retroviruses. The most striking in vivo example of ADE in humans is dengue hemorrhagic fever, a disease in which AIDE is thought to increase the severity of clinical manifestations of dengue virus infection by increasing virus replication. We examine the epidemiological impact of AIDE on the prevalence and persistence of viral serotypes. Using a dynamical system model of n cocirculating dengue serotypes, we find that AIDE may provide a competitive advantage to those serotypes that undergo enhancement compared with those that do not, and that this advantage increases with increasing numbers of cocirculating serotypes. Paradoxically, there are limits to the selective advantage provided by increasing levels of ADE, because greater levels of enhancement induce large amplitude oscillations in incidence of all dengue virus infections, threatening the persistence of both the enhanced and nonenhanced serotypes. Although the models presented here are specifically designed for dengue, our results are applicable to any epidemiological system in which partial immunity increases pathogen replication rates. Our results suggest that enhancement is most advantageous in settings where multiple serotypes circulate and where a large host population is available to support pathogen persistence during the deep troughs of ADE-induced large amplitude oscillations of virus replication.},

@article{turner_synergistic_2012,
	Abstract = {1. Seasonality of rainfall can exert a strong influence on animal condition and on hostparasite interactions. The body condition of ruminants fluctuates seasonally in response to changes in energy requirements, foraging patterns and resource availability, and seasonal variation in parasite infections may further alter ruminant body condition.   2. This study disentangles the effects of rainfall and gastrointestinal parasite infections on springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis) body condition and determines how these factors vary among demographic groups.   3. Using data from four years and three study areas, we investigated (i) the influence of rainfall variation, demographic factors and parasite interactions on parasite prevalence or infection intensity, (ii) whether parasitism or rainfall is a more important predictor of springbok body condition and (iii) how parasitism and condition vary among study areas along a rainfall gradient.   4. We found that increased parasite intensity is associated with reduced body condition only for adult females. For all other demographic groups, body condition was significantly related to prior rainfall and not to parasitism. Rainfall lagged by two months had a positive effect on body condition.   5. Adult females showed evidence of a 'periparturient rise' in parasite intensity and had higher parasite intensity and lower body condition than adult males after parturition and during early lactation. After juveniles were weaned, adult females had lower parasite intensity than adult males. Sex differences in parasitism and condition may be due to differences between adult females and males in the seasonal timing of reproductive effort and its effects on host immunity, as well as documented sex differences in vulnerability to predation.   6. Our results highlight that parasites and the environment can synergistically affect host populations, but that these interactions might be masked by their interwoven relationships, their differential impacts on demographic groups, and the different time-scales at which they operate.},

However, it is unclear whether climate directly affects the survival and fecundity of individuals, or indirectly, by influencing food and natural enemies. Here we propose that climate affects trophic interactions and could be an important mechanism for synchronizing spatially distributed populations. We show that in specific years the size of red grouse populations in northern England either increases or decreases in synchrony. In these years, widespread and correlated climatic conditions during May and July affect populations regionally and influence the density-dependent transmission of the gastrointestinal nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis, a parasite that reduces grouse fecundity(6). This in turn forces grouse populations into synchrony. We conclude that specific climatic events may lead to outbreaks of infectious diseases or pests that may cause dramatic, synchronized changes in the abundance of their hosts.},

	Abstract = {Temperature anomalies on coral reefs now routinely exceed coral stress thresholds, making temperature a critical variable to consider in coral host--pathogen systems. While tempera- ture is widely hypothesized to drive coral disease outbreaks by decreasing coral resistance and increasing pathogen growth rates, tests of the temperature hypothesis are rare. Here we report evidence from the sea fan coral Gorgonia ventalina --Aspergillus host -- pathogen system that temperature stress increases one component of sea fan resistance. Experimentally infecting sea fan fragments while increasing temperatures to reflect summertime highs in the Florida Keys, USA, caused a 176\% increase in activity of host-derived antifungal compounds. Thus, temperature stress and infection induce higher levels of resistance. However, pathogen growth rate also increases over the same temperature range, providing an opportunity for pathogen establishment before host resis- tance is maximal. This dual effect of temperature emphasizes the need to test intact host--pathogen systems. Given predictions for future warming events, aspergillosis is predicted to continue causing sea fan mortality in the Caribbean Sea.},

@article{besser_bighorn_2013,
	Abstract = {Pneumonia of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) is a dramatic disease of high morbidity and mortality first described more than 80 years ago. The etiology of the disease has been debated since its initial discovery, and at various times lungworms, Mannheimia haemolytica and other Pasteurellaceae, and Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae have been proposed as primary causal agents. A multi-factorial ``respiratory disease complex'' has also been proposed as confirmation of causation has eluded investigators. In this paper we review the evidence for each of the candidate primary agents with regard to causal criteria including strength of association, temporality, plausibility, experimental evidence, and analogy. While we find some degree of biological plausibility for all agents and strong experimental evidence for M. haemolytica, we demonstrate that of the alternatives considered, M. ovipneumoniae is the best supported by all criteria and is therefore the most parsimonious explanation for the disease. The strong but somewhat controversial experimental evidence implicating disease transmission from domestic sheep is consistent with this finding. Based on epi- demiologic and microbiologic data, we propose that healthy bighorn sheep populations are na{\"\i}ve to M. ovipneumoniae, and that its introduction to susceptible bighorn sheep popu- lations results in epizootic polymicrobial bacterial pneumonia often followed by chronic infection in recovered adults. If this hypothesized model is correct, efforts to control this disease by development or application of vectored vaccines to Pasteurellaceae are unlikely to provide significant benefits, whereas efforts to ensure segregation of healthy bighorn sheep populations from M. ovipneumoniae-infected reservoir hosts are crucial to preven- tion of new disease epizootics. It may also be possible to develop M. ovipneumoniae vaccines or other management strategies that could reduce the impact of this devastating disease in bighorn sheep.

Because amphibians are key components of communities, we emphasize the importance of investigating amphibian declines at the community level. Selection pressures over evolutionary time have molded amphibian life history characteristics, such that they may remain static even in the face of strong, recent human-induced selection pressures.},

	Abstract = {For hundreds of years, the unmanaged Soay sheep population on St Kilda has survived despite enduring presumably deleterious co-infections of helminth, protozoan and arthropod parasites and intermittent periods of starvation. Important parasite taxa in young Soay sheep are strongyles (Trichostrongylus axei, Trichostrongylus vitrinus and Teladorsagia circumcincta), coccidia (11 Eimeria species) and keds (Melophagus ovinus) and in older animals, Teladorsagia circumcincta. In this research, associations between the intensity of different parasite taxa were investigated. Secondly, the intensities of different parasite taxa were tested for associations with variation in host weight, which is itself a determinant of over-winter survival in the host population. In lambs, the intensity of strongyle eggs was positively correlated with that of Nematodirus spp. eggs, while in yearlings and adults strongyle eggs and coccidia oocysts were positively correlated. In lambs and yearlings, of the parasite taxa tested, only strongyle eggs were significantly and negatively associated with host weight. However, in adult hosts, strongyles and coccidia were independently and negatively associated with host weight. These results are consistent with the idea that strongyles and coccidia are exerting independent selection on Soay sheep.},

@article{milner_estimating_1999,
	Abstract = {1. The relative importance of density-dependent and -independent factors on interannual variation in over-winter survival was investigated in the fluctuating population of Soay sheep on St Kilda, Scotland, over the period 1985-96. 2. Population density had a negative effect on survival in lambs and adult males while adult female survival showed no evidence of density dependence over the observed range of population densities. 3. Climatic fluctuations associated with the winter North Atlantic oscillation index (NAO) also affected survival, which decreased in winters that were relatively warm, wet and windy. The effect was most pronounced in lambs. 4. Survival was modelled using logistic regression analysis with and without year fitted as a random effect. The former incorporated stochastic year to year variation in survival. Results from the two modelling approaches were similar in terms of the regression coefficients estimated. However, the standard errors of the year-dependent covariates, population size and NAO, were underestimated when the random year effect was ignored, leading to incorrect inferences about the relative significance of terms being made. 5. Using both modelling approaches, density dependence was found to have a greater influence on survival than the effect of NAO in lambs and adult males, whereas in adult females NAO was the more important. 6. Once random between-year effects were taken into account, the individually varying terms such as body weight and faecal egg count were the most significant factors explaining differences in survival.},

@article{bancroft_meta-analysis_2008,
	Abstract = {Human alterations to natural systems have resulted in a loss of biological diversity around the world. Amphibian population losses have been more severe than those of birds and mammals. Amphibian population declines are likely due to many factors including habitat loss, disease, contaminants, introduced species and ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation. The effect of UVB, however, varies widely among species and can vary within populations of the same species or at different life-history stages. This variation has often led to opposing conclusions about how UVB affects amphibians. We used meta-analysis techniques to explore the overall effects of UVB radiation on survival in amphibians. We also used recently developed factorial meta-analytic techniques to quantify potential interactions between UVB radiation and other stressors on amphibians. Ultraviolet-B radiation reduced survival of amphibians by 1.9-fold compared with shielded controls. Larvae were more susceptible to damage from UVB radiation compared with embryos, and salamanders were more susceptible compared with frogs and toads. Furthermore, UVB radiation interacted synergistically with other environmental stressors and resulted in greater than additive effects on survival when 2 stressors were present. Our results suggest that UVB radiation is an important stressor in amphibians, particularly in light of potential synergisms between UVB and other stressors in amphibian habitats.},

@article{mcdermott_brucellosis_2002-1,
	Abstract = {dBrucellosis is an important disease among livestock and people in sub-Saharan Africa. In general, the incidence is the highest in pastoral production systems and decreases as herd size and size of landholding decreases. The prevalence of risk factors for infections are best understood for bovine brucellosis and to a lesser extent for ovine and caprine brucellosis. The occurrence and epidemiology of brucellosis in pigs is poorly understood. This species bias is also reflected in control activities. As with other public-sector animal health services, the surveillance and control of brucellosis in sub-Saharan Africa is rarely implemented outside southern Africa. Brucellosis is even more ignored in humans and most cases go undiagnosed and untreated, leading to considerable suffering for those affected. Decision-making to determine the importance of brucellosis control relative to other public concerns and what brucellosis control strategies should be applied is urgently required. A strategy for how brucellosis decision-making might be considered and applied in future is outlined. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{godfroid_brucellosis_2011,
	Abstract = {Following the recent discovery of new Brucella strains from different animal species and from the environment, ten Brucella species are nowadays included in the genus Brucella. Although the intracellular trafficking of Brucella is well described, the strategies developed by Brucella to survive and multiply in phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, particularly to access nutriments during its intracellular journey, are still largely unknown. Metabolism and virulence of Brucella are now considered to be two sides of the same coin. Mechanisms presiding to the colonization of the pregnant uterus in different animal species are not known. Vaccination is the cornerstone of control programs in livestock and although the 519, RB51 (both in cattle) and Rev 1 (in sheep and goats) vaccines have been successfully used worldwide, they have drawbacks and thus the ideal brucellosis vaccine is still very much awaited. There is no vaccine available for pigs and wildlife. Animal brucellosis control strategies differ in the developed and the developing world. Most emphasis is put on eradication and on risk analysis to avoid the re-introduction of Brucella in the developed world. Information related to the prevalence of brucellosis is still scarce in the developing world and control programs are rarely implemented. Since there is no vaccine available for humans, prevention of human brucellosis relies on its control in the animal reservoir. Brucella is also considered to be an agent to be used in bio- and agroterrorism attacks. At the animal/ecosystem/human interface it is critical to reduce opportunities for Brucella to jump host species as already seen in livestock, wildlife and humans. This task is a challenge for the future in terms of veterinary public health, as for wildlife and ecosystem managers and will need a "One Health" approach to be successful. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

@article{alexander_buffalo_2012,
	Abstract = {Background: Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease of global importance infecting humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. Little is known about the epidemiology and persistence of brucellosis in wildlife in Southern Africa, particularly in Botswana.   Methods: Archived wildlife samples from Botswana (1995-2000) were screened with the Rose Bengal Test (RBT) and fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) and included the African buffalo (247), bushbuck (1), eland (5), elephant (25), gemsbok (1), giraffe (9), hartebeest (12), impala (171), kudu (27), red lechwe (10), reedbuck (1), rhino (2), springbok (5), steenbok (2), warthog (24), waterbuck (1), wildebeest (33), honey badger (1), lion (43), and zebra (21). Human case data were extracted from government annual health reports (1974-2006).   Findings: Only buffalo (6\%, 95\% CI 3.04\%-8.96\%) and giraffe (11\%, 95\% CI 0-38.43\%) were confirmed seropositive on both tests. Seropositive buffalo were widely distributed across the buffalo range where cattle density was low. Human infections were reported in low numbers with most infections (46\%) occurring in children ({\textless}14 years old) and no cases were reported among people working in the agricultural sector.   Conclusions: Low seroprevalence of brucellosis in Botswana buffalo in a previous study in 1974 and again in this survey suggests an endemic status of the disease in this species. Buffalo, a preferred source of bush meat, is utilized both legally and illegally in Botswana. Household meat processing practices can provide widespread pathogen exposure risk to family members and the community, identifying an important source of zoonotic pathogen transmission potential. Although brucellosis may be controlled in livestock populations, public health officials need to be alert to the possibility of human infections arising from the use of bush meat. This study illustrates the need for a unified approach in infectious disease research that includes consideration of both domestic and wildlife sources of infection in determining public health risks from zoonotic disease invasions.},

	Abstract = {A survey to determine the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis and certain other infectious diseases was conducted on 42 free-ranging African buffaloes, (Syncerus caffer) from May to June 1997 in the Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda. Using the gamma interferon test, exposure to M. bovis was detected in 21.6\% of the buffaloes. One dead buffalo and an emaciated warthog (Phacochoerus aethippicus) that was euthanased, were necropsied; both had miliary granulomas from which M. bovis was isolated. None of the buffaloes sampled in Sector A of the park, which has no cattle interface, tested positive for bovine tuberculosis (BTB) exposure. The prevalence and distribution of BTB does not appear to have changed significantly since the 1960s, but this may be due to fluxes in the buffalo population. Serological testing for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) demonstrated positive exposure of 57.1\% of the buffaloes sampled, with types A, 0 and SAT 1-3, which is the first known report of FMD antibodies to A and 0 types in free ranging African buffaloes. Foot-and-mouth disease virus types SAT 1 and SAT 3 were isolated from buffalo probang samples. Two percent of the buffaloes had been exposed to brucellosis. None of the buffaloes tested had antibodies to rinderpest, leptospirosis or Q fever.},

@article{altizer_seasonality_2006,
	Abstract = {Seasonal variations in temperature, rainfall and resource availability are ubiquitous and can exert strong pressures on population dynamics. Infectious diseases provide some of the best-studied examples of the role of seasonality in shaping population fluctuations. In this paper, we review examples from human and wildlife disease systems to illustrate the challenges inherent in understanding the mechanisms and impacts of seasonal environmental drivers. Empirical evidence points to several biologically distinct mechanisms by which seasonality can impact host-pathogen interactions, including seasonal changes in host social behaviour and contact rates, variation in encounters with infective stages in the environment, annual pulses of host births and deaths and changes in host immune defences. Mathematical models and field observations show that the strength and mechanisms of seasonality can alter the spread and persistence of infectious diseases, and that population-level responses can range from simple annual cycles to more complex multiyear fluctuations. From an applied perspective, understanding the timing and causes of seasonality offers important insights into how parasite-host systems operate, how and when parasite control measures should be applied, and how disease risks will respond to anthropogenic climate change and altered patterns of seasonality. Finally, by focusing on well-studied examples of infectious diseases, we hope to highlight general insights that are relevant to other ecological interactions.},

	Abstract = {The epidemiology of human brucellosis, the commonest zoonotic infection worldwide, has drastically changed over the past decade because of various sanitary, socioeconomic, and political reasons, together with the evolution of international travel. Several areas traditionally considered to be endemic-eg, France, Israel, and most of Latin America-have achieved control of the disease. On the other hand, new foci of human brucellosis have emerged, particularly in central Asia, while the situation in certain countries of the near east (eg, Syria) is rapidly worsening. Furthermore, the disease is still present, in varying trends, both in European countries and in the USA. Awareness of this new global map of human brucellosis will allow for proper interventions from international public-health organisations.},

	Abstract = {Poverty is now at the heart of development discourse; we discuss how it is measured and understood. We next consider the negative and positive impacts of livestock on pro-poor development. Taking a value-chain approach that includes keepers, users and eaters of livestock, we identify diseases that are road blocks on the 'three livestock pathways out of poverty'. We discuss livestock impacts on poverty reduction and review attempts to prioritize the livestock diseases relevant to the poor. We make suggestions for metrics that better measure disease impact and show the benefits of more rigorous evaluation before reviewing recent attempts to measure the importance of disease to the poor. High impact of a disease does not guarantee high benefits from its control; other factors must be taken into consideration, including technical feasibility and political desirability. We conclude by considering how we might better understand and exploit the roles of livestock and improved animal health by posing three speculative questions on the impact of livestock diseases and their control on global poverty: how can understanding livestock and poverty links help disease control?; if global poverty reduction was the aim of livestock disease control, how would it differ from the current model?; and how much of the impact of livestock disease on poverty is due to disease control policy rather than disease itself?},

@article{ferguson_effect_1999,
	Abstract = {Cross-reactive antibodies produced by a mammalian host during infection by a particular microparasitic strain usually have the effect of reducing the probability of the host being infected by a different, but closely related, pathogen strain, Such cross-reactive immunological responses thereby induce between-strain competition within the pathogen population. However, in some cases such as dengue virus, evidence suggests that cross-reactive antibodies act to enhance rather than restrict the severity of a subsequent infection by another strain. This cooperative mechanism is thought to explain why pre-existing immunity to dengue virus is an important risk factor for the development of severe disease (i.e., dengue shock syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever). In this paper, we explore the effect of antibody-dependent enhancement on the transmission dynamics of multistrain pathogen populations. We show that enhancement frequently may generate complex and persistent cyclical or chaotic epidemic behavior. Furthermore, enhancement acts to permit the coexistence of all strains where in its absence only one or a subset would persist.},

	Abstract = {In many countries in Asia and South-America dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) has become a substantial public health concern leading to serious social-economic costs. Mathematical models describing the transmission of dengue viruses have focussed on the so-called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect and temporary cross-immunity trying to explain the irregular behavior of dengue epidemics by analyzing available data. However, no systematic investigation of the possible dynamical structures has been performed so far. Our study focuses on a seasonally forced (non-autonomous) model with temporary cross-immunity and possible secondary infection, motivated by dengue fever epidemiology. The notion of at least two different strains is needed in a minimalistic model to describe differences between primary infections, often asymptomatic, and secondary infection, associated with the severe form of the disease. We extend the previously studied non-seasonal (autonomous) model by adding seasonal forcing, mimicking the vectorial dynamics, and a low import of infected individuals, which is realistic in the dynamics of dengue fever epidemics. A comparative study between three different scenarios (non-seasonal, low seasonal and high seasonal with a low import of infected individuals) is performed. The extended models show complex dynamics and qualitatively a good agreement between empirical DHF monitoring data and the obtained model simulation. We discuss the role of seasonal forcing and the import of infected individuals in such systems, the biological relevance and its implications for the analysis of the available dengue data. At the moment only such minimalistic models have a chance to be qualitatively understood well and eventually tested against existing data. The simplicity of the model (low number of parameters and state variables) offer a promising perspective on parameter values inference from the DHF case notifications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {In group living vertebrates, patterns of parasite infection vary within and between populations because of environmental and social factors. In the present study, we investigated patterns of parasite product excretion in graylag geese, focusing on environ- mental (season and temperature), individual (sex and age), and social factors (pair-bond status, reproductive state, and rearing condition). From March 2008 to May 2010, we collected 3574 samples from 171 individuals and analyzed them for nematode eggs and coccidian oocysts. Fecal samples that were infected with nematode eggs were also positive for coccidian oocyst to a higher rate. Fecal samples of goose-raised geese were positive for nematode eggs more often than those of hand-raised geese. In parental birds, the number of goslings fledged had a positive influence on the percentage of samples positive for nematode eggs. The number of samples infected with coccidian oocysts decreased with age. In parent birds, the number of samples found to be positive for coccidian oocysts decreased during the parental season, and female bird samples were positive more often than those of males. In graylag goslings, the number of fecal samples with coccidian oocysts was influenced by the goslings' age, with maximum excretion at 13 weeks. This is the first evidence to demonstrate an effect of a set of interacting environmental (e.g., season), individual (e.g., sex, age), and social (e.g., rearing condition, number of goslings fledged) factors on rate of para- site excretion in a socially complex bird. Our results suggest that socially stressful periods may have implications for individual health in graylag geese.},

	Abstract = {Facultative sex allocation theories predict that animals will bias their offspring's sex in response to environmental cues. Biased sex ratios can be a problem when managing small populations in the wild or captivity. Using rainfall and calving records from Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park in South Africa, we compared seasonal and annual rainfall with calving rates and sex of the calves. Between 1989-2004,159 calves were sighted soon enough after birth to reliably attribute their conception to a particular season and year. Conceptions were strongly seasonal, with most (73.6\%) occurring during rainy seasons and the remainder during dry seasons. Overall progeny sex ratio for the period 1989-2004 was 53.1\% male. Mothers were more likely to be observed with male calves if they conceived during the wet season (57.3\% male) than during the dry season (42.9\% male) in accordance with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis. Similar numbers of conceptions that resulted in calves occurred during wet and dry years (52.2\% of conceptions occurred during wet years). Mothers were more likely to raise male calves if they conceived during wet years (60.2\% male) than during dry years (46.1\% male). Removal of males from small populations might be particularly important after a sequence of wet years to facilitate greater population growth.},

	Abstract = {We examined annual variation in the timing of conception and parturition in the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and the synchrony of birth timing with resource cues, using 8 years of monthly birth, rainfall, and vegetation data, measured as Nor- malized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Monthly births had the strongest significant correlations with NDVI and rainfall levels 12 and 13 months in the past, respectively. In addition, the synchrony of current year births corresponds most strongly to the synchrony of the previous year's NDVI distribution. Because the gestation period of buffalo has been estimated to be around 11 months, these findings suggest that improved protein levels, occurring approximately a month after the first green flush of the wet season, are either a trigger for conception or conception has evolved to be synchronous with correlated environmental cues that ensure females enter a period of peak body condition around the time of conception and/or parturition. With a gestation period of approximately 340 days, parturition occurs to take advantage of the period when forage has its highest protein content. A comparative analysis of gestation periods within the subfamily Bovinae indicates that African buffalo have a protracted gestation for their body size, which we suggest is an adaptation to their seasonal environment. We also found that interannual variation in the birth distribution suggests a degree of plasticity in the date of conception, and variation in the number of calves born each year suggest further synchrony at a timescale longer than a single year.},

	Abstract = {(1) Several models describing the dynamics of host-parasite associations are discussed.
(2) The models contain the central assumption that the parasite increases the rate of host mortalities. The parasite induced changes in this rate are formulated as functions of the parasite numbers per host and hence of the statistical distribution of the parasites within the host population.
(3) The parameters influencing the ability of the parasite to regulate the growth of its host's population, and the stability of parasite induced equilibria, are examined for each model.
(4) Three specific categories of population processes are shown to be of particular significance in stabilizing the dynamical behaviour of host-parasite interactions and enhancing the regulatory role of the parasite.
These categories are overdispersion of parasite numbers per host, nonlinear functional relationships between parasite burden per host and host death rate, and density depen- dent constraints on parasite population growth within individual hosts.},

In 45 of the 49 (90 \%) data-sets, the negative binomial distribution provided a statistically satisfactory fit. In the other 4 data-sets the negative binomial distribution still provided a better fit than the Poisson distribution, and only 1 of the data-sets fitted the Poisson distribution. The degree of aggregation was large, with 43 of the 49 data-sets having an estimated k of less than 1 From these 19 data-sets, 22 subsets of host data were available (i.e. host data could be divided by either host sex, age, where or when hosts were sampled). In 11 of these 22 subsets there was significant variation in the degree of aggregation between host subsets of the same host-parasite system. A common k estimate was always larger than that obtained with all the host data considered together. These results indicate that lumping host data can hide important variations in aggregation between hosts and can exaggerate the true degree of aggregation. Wherever possible common k estimates should be used to estimate the degree of aggregation. In addition, significant differences in the degree of aggregation between subgroups of host data, were generally associated with significant differences in both mean parasite burdens and the prevalence of infection.},

	Abstract = {The main aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the social hierarchy of plain zebra, Equus quagga, and the level of parasitism. For the study 141 fecal samples from the same number of animals were collected within the two major populations of E. quagga of Uganda (Lake Mburo Conservation Area and Kidepo Valley National Park). Quantitative (eggs per gram of feces) and qualitative parasite assessment were performed with standard methods. The relationship between parasite burden and individual host features was analyzed using Generalized Linear Models. Strongyles, cestodes, Strongyloides sp. and oxiurids where present in the examined samples. Social rank and age class significantly affect all parasites' abundance with dominant individuals being less parasitized than subordinate individuals, regardless of the parasite groups excluding oxiurids. Sex could not been shown to be related with any of the found parasites. Age was positively related with strongyles and oxiurids abundance and negatively related with cestodes and Strongyloides sp. The main result of the present study was the evidence that social status influences parasite level with dominant zebras shedding less parasite eggs than subordinate ones. Social rank appears, therefore, as an important factor giving rise to parasite aggregation in plain zebras. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{morrill_random_2012,
	Abstract = {Parasite aggregation is viewed as a natural law in parasite-host ecology but is a paradox insofar as parasites should follow the Poisson distribution if hosts are encountered randomly. Much research has focused on whether parasite aggregation in or on hosts is explained by aggregation of infective parasite stages in the environment, or by heterogeneity within host samples in terms of host responses to infection (e.g., through representation of different age classes of hosts). In this paper, we argue that the typically aggregated distributions of parasites may be explained simply. We propose that aggregated distributions can be derived from parasites encountering hosts randomly, but subsequently by parasites being 'lost' from hosts based on condition-linked escape or immunity of hosts. Host condition should be a normally distributed trait even among otherwise homogeneous sets of hosts. Our model shows that mean host condition and variation in host condition have different effects on the different metrics of parasite aggregation. Our model further predicts that as host condition increases, parasites become more aggregated but numbers of attending parasites are reduced overall and this is important for parasite population dynamics. The effects of deviation from random encounter are discussed with respect to the relationship between host condition and final parasite numbers.

	Abstract = {Individual variation in infection modulates both the dynamics of pathogens and their impact on host populations. It is therefore crucial to identify differential patterns of infection and understand the mechanisms responsible. Yet our understanding of infection heterogeneity in wildlife is limited, even for important zoonotic host-pathogen systems, owing to the intractability of host status prior to infection. Using novel applications of stable isotope ecology and eco-immunology, we distinguish antecedent behavioural and physiological traits associated with avian influenza virus (AIV) infection in free-living Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii). Swans infected with AIV exhibited higher serum delta(13)C (-25.3 +/- 0.4) than their non-infected counterparts (-26.3 +/- 0.2). Thus, individuals preferentially foraging in aquatic rather than terrestrial habitats experienced a higher risk of infection, suggesting that the abiotic requirements of AIV give rise to heterogeneity in pathogen exposure. Juveniles were more likely to be infected (30.8\% compared with 11.3\% for adults), shed approximately 15-fold higher quantity of virus and exhibited a lower specific immune response than adults. Together, these results demonstrate the potential for heterogeneity in infection to have a profound influence on the dynamics of pathogens, with concomitant impacts on host habitat selection and fitness.},

@article{luong_strong_2011,
	Abstract = {The vast majority of parasites exhibit an aggregated frequency distribution within their host population, such that most hosts have few or no parasites while only a minority of hosts are heavily infected. One exception to this rule is the trophically transmitted parasite Pterygodermatites peromysci of the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), which is randomly distributed within its host population. Here, we ask: what are the factors generating the random distribution of parasites in this system when the majority of macroparasites exhibit non-random patterns? We hypothesise that tight density-dependent processes constrain parasite establishment and survival, preventing the build-up of parasites within individual hosts, and preclude aggregation within the host population. We first conducted primary infections in a laboratory experiment using white-footed mice to test for density-dependent parasite establishment and survival of adult worms. Secondary or challenge infection experiments were then conducted to investigate underlying mechanisms, including intra-specific competition and host-mediated restrictions (i.e. acquired immunity). The results of our experimental infections show a dose-dependent constraint on within-host-parasite establishment, such that the proportion of nice infected rose initially with exposure, and then dropped off at the highest dose. Additional evidence of density-dependent competition comes from the decrease in worm length with increasing levels of exposure. In the challenge infection experiment, previous exposure to parasites resulted in a lower prevalence and intensity of infection compared with primary infection of naive mice; the magnitude of this effect was also density-dependent. Host immune response (IgG levels) increased with the level of exposure, but decreased with the number of worms established. Our results suggest that strong intra-specific competition and acquired host immunity operate in a density-dependent manner to constrain parasite establishment, driving down aggregation and ultimately accounting for the observed random distribution of parasites.

	Abstract = {A longitudinal survey was conducted to determine the prevalence and loads of gastrointestinal parasites in goats raised by communal farmers of Qaukeni (QA) and Nkosana (NK) communities of Eastern Cape Province of South Africa between June 2007 and April 2008. One hundred and seventy one goats were weighed and had faecal samples collected from their recta in four seasons; cold-dry, hot-dry, hot-wet and the post-rainy seasons. The samples were examined by the modified McMaster technique for nematode egg types. Goats in QA weighed more (P \&lt; 0.05) than those in NK in the post-rainy, cold-dry and hot-dry seasons. However, in the hot-wet season, goats in NK had higher (P \&lt; 0.05) weights than those in QA. The most frequently detected gastrointestinal eggs were the strongyle egg type (68.4 $\pm$ 8.49 in QA and 96.1 $\pm$ 12.01 in NK), followed by coccidial oocysts (53.3 $\pm$ 8.76 in QA and 68.8 $\pm$ 8.00 in NK). The other identified nematodes were Strongyloides and Trichostrongylus egg types. Higher loads (P \&lt; 0.05) of strongyle eggs were observed in the hot-wet and post-rainy seasons, whilst the other egg types showed a peak in the hot-wet season. Strongyle egg counts were higher (P \&lt; 0.05) in NK compared to QA. The results indicate that strongyles are the major gastrointestinal egg types negatively affecting body weights of goats.},

Samples with OPGs \&GE;2000 were allowed to sporulate in potassium dichromate solution at room temperature. Species identification was done by measurement and morphological characteristic of each species. At Mallesons, 29\% of samples were positive, at Kaalplaas 50\% and at Pienaars River 52\%. The most prevalent species were Eimeria zuernii and E. ellipsoidalis at Mallesons, E. zuernii and E. bovis at Kaalplaas and E. bovis and E. zuernii at Pienaars River, respectively.

In two of these animals sarcocysts were also found in the oesophagi. Furthermore, an oesophagus from an additional older buffalo was positive. Sarcocysts were not seen in 7 buffaloes younger than one year. Light and electron microscopic investigations revealed sarcocysts with a cyst wall ultrastructure belonging to the type 21 of the classification by Dubey et al. (1989a). For the first time this type of sarcocyst is described in African buffaloes. Encapsulation of the host cell (''secondary cyst wall''), often present in other Sarcocystis species with macrocysts, was lacking. The cyst wall was morphologically similar to S. fusiformis isolated from the water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). However, dimorphism of cystozoites, not known in S. fusiformis, was noted. Some sarcocysts had short plump, and others long banana-shaped cystozoites. This phenomenon is discussed, considering also the possibility of sexual dimorphism.},

	Abstract = {This report addresses various aspects of the protozoan parasite Eimeria which contribute to their increasing recognition as important protozoal pathogens in cattle. Among others, questions of parasite biology and epidemiology, its impact on host physiology, and control strategies are dealt with. The tenacious oocysts are found ubiquitously in the environment making an infection of calves and young cattle, the most susceptible age group. almost inevitable. Further development, comprising of asexual multiplication, the merogony, and a subsequent sexual stage, the gamogony, takes place within cells of the small and large intestines, after which numerous unsporulated oocysts are formed and shed with the faeces. Of the more than a dozen species. Eimeria bovis and Eimeria zuernii only are made responsible for severe clinical disease characterized by haemorrhagic diarrhoea with sometimes fatal outcome. To a lesser extent, Eimeria alabamensis also can cause clinical disease. Because of the damage inflicted oil the intestinal tissue, the digestive process and overall homeostasis can become severly affected, even with absence of clinical disease, with adverse effects on animal welfare and performance. The consequent economic losses for the cattle industry are thus substantial. Active (species specific) immunity, both humoral and cellular, develops rapidly after first antigen contact. its intensity being dependent oil the number of oocysts ingested. However, no absolute protection is achieved and even older animals can excrete oocysts, contributing to a state of endemic stability. For efficient control, exact diagnosis of the Eimeria species involved and the evaluation of animal management and husbandry practices are of utmost importance. Mixed infections are the rule and only an occurrence of pathogenic species, together with clinical symptoms, justifies the assumption of a coccidiosis. Proper hygiene regime and ensuring unfavourable conditions for oocyst survival in the environment (cool and dry, disinfection procedures) will help to reduce infection pressure on the herd. Of the various pharmacological compounds used to treat coccidiosis, those which act against the late developmental stages, administered during prepatency (metaphylactically rather than therapeutically), are currently considered most effective.},

@article{gasbarre_role_2001,
	Abstract = {Gastrointestinal nematode infections of cattle remain a constraint on the efficient raising of cattle on pasture throughout the world. Most of the common genera of parasites found in cattle stimulate an effective level of protective immunity in most animals within the herd after the animals have been on pasture for several months. In contrast, cattle remain susceptible to infection by Ostertagia for many months, and immunity that actually reduces the development of newly acquired larvae is usually not evident until the animals are more than 2 years old. This prolonged susceptibility to reinfection is a major reason that this parasite remains the most economically important GI nematode in temperate regions of the world. Although, animals remain susceptible to reinfection for a prolonged period of time, there are a number of manifestations of the immune response that result in an enhanced level of herd immunity. These include a delay in the development time of the parasites, an increase in the number of larvae that undergo an inhibition in development, morphological changes in the worms, stunting of newly acquired worms, and most importantly a reduction in the number of eggs produced by the female worms. The overall result of these manifestations of immunity is a reduction in parasite transmission within the cattle herd. The immune mechanisms responsible for these different types of functional immunity remain to be defined. In general, CI nematode infections in mammals elicit very strong Th2-like responses characterized by high levels of Interleukin 4 (IL4), high levels of IgG1 and IgE antibodies, and large numbers of mast cells. In cattle, the most extensively studied GI nematode, in regards to host immune responses, is Ostertagia ostertagi. In Ostertagia infections, antigens are presented to the host in the draining lymph nodes very soon after infection, and within the first 3-4 days of infection these cells have left the nodes, entered the peripheral circulation, and have homed to tissues immediately surrounding the parasite where they become established. The immune response seen in the abomasum is in many ways are similar to that seen other mammalian hosts, with high levels of expression of IL4 in the draining lymph nodes and in lymphocytes isolated from the mucosa. But unlike a number of other systems, lymphocyte populations taken from Ostertagia infected cattle seem to be up-regulated for a number of other cytokines, most notably Interferon-(IFN-(), implying that in Ostertagia infections, the immune response elicit is not simply a stereotypic Th2 response. In addition, effector cell populations in the tissues surrounding the parasites, are not typical, inferring the Ostertagia has evolved means to suppress or evade protective immune mechanisms. Studies have also demonstrated that the number of nematode eggs/gram (EPG) in feces of pastured cattle is strongly influenced by host genetics and that the heritability of this trait is approxiamately 0.30. In addition, EPG values are not {\textless} {\textless} normally {\textgreater} {\textgreater} distributed and a small percentage of a herd is responsible for the majority of parasite transmission. This suggests that genetic management of a small percentage of the herd can considerably reduce overall parasite transmission. A selective breeding program has been initiated to identify the host genes controlling resistance/susceptibility to the parasites. The best indicator of the number of Cooperia infecting a host is the EPG value, while Ostertagia is best measured by serum pepsinogen levels, weight gain, and measures of anemia. Other phenotypic measures are either not significantly associated with parasite numbers or are very weakly correlated. In addition, calves can be separated into three types: (1) Type I which never demonstrates high EPG values. (2) Type II which shows rises in EPC values through the first 2 months on pasture which then fall and remain at levels associated with Type I calves, and (3) Type III calves which maintain high EPG levels. The approximate percentage of these calves is 25:50:25 respectively. Because these cattle are segregating for traits involved in resistance and susceptibility to GI nematodes, this resource population is being used to effectively detect the genomic locations of these Economic Trait Loci (ETL). For relational analysis between phenotype and genome location, over 80,000 genotypes have been generated by PCR amplification, and marker genotypes have been scored to produce inheritance data. The marker allele inheritance data is currently being statistically analyzed to detect patterns of co-segregation between allele haplotype and EPG phenotypes. Statistical power of this genome-wide scan has been strengthened by including genotypic data from the historic pedigree. In our herd, paternal half-sib families range from 5-13 progeny/sire, and extensive marker genotypes are available from ancestors of the population most of which are paternally descended from a single founding sire. Once ETL have been identified the next will be to refine ETL map resolution in attempt to discover the genes underlying disease phenotypes. Accurate identification of genes controlling resistance will offer the producer several alternatives for disease control. For a non-organic producer, the small percentage of susceptible animals can be targeted for drug administration. This approach would reduce both the cost of anthelmintics used and the odds for selection of drug resistant mutants, because the selective agent (drug) would not be applied over the entire parasite population. A second treatment option would be based on correcting a heritable immunologic condition. In this case, susceptible animals could be the targets for immunotherapy involving vaccines of immunomodulation. A final option would be genetic selection to remove susceptible animals from the herd. Producers with a high degree of risk for parasite-induced production losses, such as organic producers of producers in geographic areas with environmental conditions favorable to high rates of transmission would benefit the most from this strategy. In contrast, producers at low risk could take a more conservative approach and select against susceptibility when other factors were equal. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

@article{jolles_interactions_2008,
	Abstract = {Epidemiological studies typically focus on single-parasite systems, although most hosts harbor multiple parasite species; thus, the potential impacts of co-infection on disease dynamics are only beginning to be recognized. Interactions between macroparasites, such as gastrointestinal nematodes, and microparasites causing diseases like TB, AIDS, and malaria are particularly interesting because co-infection may favor transmission and progression of these important diseases. Here we present evidence for strong interactions between gastrointestinal worms and bovine tuberculosis (TB) in free-ranging African buffalo (Syncerus caffer). TB and worms are negatively associated at the population, among-herd, and within-herd scales, and this association is not solely the result of demographic heterogeneities in infection. Combining data from 1362 buffalo with simple mechanistic models, we find that both accelerated mortality of co-infected individuals and TB transmission heterogeneity caused by trade-offs in immunity to the two types of parasites likely contribute to observed infection patterns. This study is one of the first to examine the relevance of within-host immunological trade-offs for understanding parasite distribution patterns in natural populations.},

	Abstract = {Most animals are concurrently infected with multiple parasites, and interactions among these parasites may influence both disease dynamics and host fitness. However, the sublethal costs of parasite infections are difficult to measure and the effects of concomitant infections with multiple parasite species on individual physiology and fitness are poorly described for wild hosts. To understand the direct and indirect physiological costs of co-infection, we investigated the relationships among gastrointestinal parasite richness, species identity, and abundance and host hematological parameters, body condition, and investment in lymphocyte defenses. Using aggregate-scale parasite data from African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), we found few direct or indirect associations between infection and hematology in male hosts, and no significant associations were observed in female hosts or with respect to body condition in either sex. These results suggest that only strong physiological effects are detectable with aggregate-scale parasite data, and that hematological variables may be more sensitive to changes in condition than standard body fat condition indices. Analyses accounting for parasite species identity in female buffalo revealed that different parasites show distinct relationships with host hematology, body condition, and immune investment. However, four of six species-specific associations were obscured when parasites were considered in combination. Overall, fitness-related physiological mediators such as hematological indices may provide assessments of direct and indirect effects of parasite infection, particularly when parasite species identity and community composition are considered.},

@article{ezenwa_host_2011,
	Abstract = {Concurrent infections with multiple parasites are ubiquitous in nature. Coinfecting parasites can interact with one another in a variety of ways, including through the host's immune system via mechanisms such as immune trade-offs and immunosuppression. These within-host immune processes mediating interactions among parasites have been described in detail, but how they scale up to determine disease dynamic patterns at the population level is only beginning to be explored. In this review, we use helminth-microparasite coinfection as a model for examining how within-host immunological effects may influence the ecological outcome of microparasitic diseases, with a specific focus on disease invasion. The current literature on coinfection between helminths and major microparasitic diseases includes many studies documenting the effects of helminths on individual host responses to microparasites. In many cases, the observed host responses map directly onto parameters relevant for quantifying disease dynamics; however, there have been few attempts at integrating data on individual-level effects into theoretical models to extrapolate from the individual to the population level. Moreover, there is considerable variability in the particular combination of disease parameters affected by helminths across different microparasite systems. We develop a conceptual framework identifying some potential sources of such variability: Pathogen persistence and severity, and resource availability to hosts. We also generate testable hypotheses regarding diseases and the environmental contexts when the effects of helminths on microparasite dynamics should be most pronounced. Finally, we use a case study of helminth and mycobacterial coinfection in the African buffalo to illustrate both progress and challenges in understanding the population-level consequences of within-host immunological interactions, and conclude with suggestions for future research that will help improve our understanding of the effects of coinfection on dynamics of infectious diseases.},

	Abstract = {The amphibian fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has received considerable attention due to its role in amphibian population declines worldwide. Although many amphibian species appear to be affected by Bd, there is little information on species-specific differences in susceptibility to this pathogen. We used a comparative experimental approach to examine Bd susceptibility in 6 amphibian species from the United States. We exposed postmetamorphic animals to Bd for 30 days and monitored mortality, feeding rates, and infection levels. In all species tested, Bd-exposed animals had higher rates of mortality than unexposed (control) animals. However, we found differences in mortality rates among species even though the amount of Bd detected on the different species' bodies did not differ. Of the species tested, southern toads (Anaxyrus terrestris) and wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) had the highest rates of Bd-related mortality. Within species, we detected lower levels of Bd on individuals that survived longer and found that the relationship between body size and infection levels differed among species. Our results indicate that, even under identical conditions, amphibian species differ in susceptibility to Bd. This study represents a step toward identifying and understanding species variation in disease susceptibility, which can be used to optimize conservation strategies.},

@article{garside_immunopathology_2000,
	Abstract = {The relationship between intestinal pathology and immune expulsion of gastrointestinal nematodes remains controversial. Parasite expulsion is associated with intestinal pathology in several model systems and both of these phenomena are T cell dependent. However, while immune expulsion of gastrointestinal helminth parasites is usually associated with Th2 responses, the effector mechanisms directly responsible for parasite lass have not been elucidated. In contrast, the intestinal pathology observed in many other disease models closely resembles that seen in helminth infections, but has been attributed to Th1 cytokines. We have used infection with the nematode Trichinella spiralis in mice defective for cytokines to demonstrate that although parasite expulsion is indeed IL-4 dependent, contrary to expectations, the enteropathy is also regulated by IL-4. Furthermore, abrogation of severe pathology in iNOS deficient and TNF receptor defective animals does not prevent parasite expulsion. TNF and iNOS are therefore involved in intestinal pathology in nematode infections, apparently under regulation by IL-4 and Th2 mediated responses. Therefore, it appears that the IL-4-dependent protective response against the parasite operates by a mechanism other than merely the gross degradation of the parasite's environment brought about by the immune enteropathy. However, it remains important to elucidate the protective mechanisms involved in parasite expulsion, which are still unclear.},

	Abstract = {1. It is well known that gastrointestinal nematodes can have a significant impact on the growth of farmed ruminants. The clinical signs of these parasites are often subtle, with production losses mainly due to reductions in host appetite and gut function. However, little is known about the impact of this widespread group of parasites on wild ruminants. We use experiments and cross-sectional data to investigate the effects of gastrointestinal nematodes on a wild host, the Svalbard reindeer. 2. Individually marked reindeer were treated for parasites. Their body mass, back fat depth and fecundity were compared with the control group one year later. The effect of treatment on worm burdens was investigated in a subsample of animals that were culled 3 and 6 months after treatment. Also, the relationship between the intensity of infection and body mass, back fat depth and host pregnancy rates was investigated in cross-sectional data from culled reindeer. 3. The anthelmintic treatment caused an increase in the body mass, back fat depth and fecundity of the reindeer. Treatment depressed the abundance of adult parasites of Ostertagia gruehneri for at least 6 months, but had no significant effect on the abundance of adults of the other dominant parasite species, Marshallagi marshalli, or the abundance of larval stages of either species. 4. In the cross-sectional study, the probability of a reindeer being pregnant in late winter was negatively related to the abundance of adult O. gruehneri when controlling for host body mass. However, no clear evidence were found for an effect of parasitism on host condition in the cross-sectional study. 5. Our experimental results show for the first time in a natural ruminant host population that gastrointestinal nematodes can have a significant effect on host condition and fecundity. However, effects of infection on host condition was not detectable in the cross-sectional study. Also, we show that the experimental effects on host condition and fecundity is most likely to be due to a negative effect of O. gruehneri, while the experimental design did not allow detection of potential negative effects of M. marshalli.},

	Abstract = {While the importance of changes in host biodiversity for disease risk continues to gain empirical support, the influence of natural variation in parasite diversity on epidemiological outcomes remains largely overlooked. Here, we combined field infection data from 2,191 amphibian hosts representing 158 parasite assemblages with mechanistic experiments to evaluate the influence of parasite richness on both parasite transmission and host fitness. Using a guild of larval trematode parasites (six species) and an amphibian host, our experiments contrasted the effects of parasite richness vs. composition, observed vs. randomized assemblages, and additive vs. replacement designs. Consistent with the dilution effect hypothesis extended to intrahost diversity, increases in parasite richness reduced overall infection success, including infections by the most virulent parasite. However, the effects of parasite richness on host growth and survival were context dependent; pathology increased when parasites were administered additively, even when the presence of the most pathogenic species was held constant, but decreased when added species replaced or reduced virulent species, emphasizing the importance of community composition and assembly. These results were similar or stronger when community structures were weighted by their observed frequencies in nature. The field data also revealed the highly nested structure of parasite assemblages, with virulent species generally occupying basal positions, suggesting that increases in parasite richness and antagonism in nature will decrease virulent infections. Our findings emphasize the importance of parasite biodiversity and coinfection in affecting epidemiological responses and highlight the value of integrating research on biodiversity and community ecology for understanding infectious diseases.},

	Abstract = {Following the recent invasion of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) into the Kruger National Park, South Africa, we conducted a study on the maintenance host, African buffalo, to investigate associations between BTB prevalence and calf:cow ratio, age structure, body condition, and endoparasite load. Statistical analyses compared herds of zero, medium (1-40\%), and high ({\textgreater}40\%) BTB prevalence. To control for ecological Variation across the park we collected data in northern, central, and southern regions and restricted some analyses to particular regions of the park. Body condition declined over the course of the 2001 dry season, and buffaloes in the southern region of the park, with the highest BTB prevalence, were in worse condition than buffaloes in the northern region (which receives less annual rainfall but is still virtually BTB-free). Herd-level analyses of the entire park, the south and central regions, and just the southern region all indicated that herds of higher BTB prevalence were in worse condition and lost condition faster through the dry season than herds of lower BTB prevalence. Fecal endoparasite egg counts increased during the dry season and were associated with both decreased body condition and increased BTB prevalence. Although we did not detect any obvious effect of BTB on the age structure of the buffalo population, our findings indicate early symptoms of wider scale BTB-related ecological disturbances: buffalo herds with high BTB prevalence appear more vulnerable to drought (because of a decrease in body condition and an increase in endoparasite load), and because lions selectively kill weak buffaloes their prey base is accumulating a disproportionately high prevalence of BTB, to which lions are susceptible.},

The overall prevalence was 71\% and the average number of worms was 2346 (range: 0--15 980). This is a small burden for such a large mammal. Sex, age and body condition of the buffaloes had no significant effect on worm occurrence.},

However. tall grass standards also represent a more stable damp microclimate for gastrointestinal parasite larvae and tall swards contain generally greater numbers of parasites than short swards, Herbivores may then trade-off the need to maximise nutrient intake through the selection of tail swards with the need to avoid parasite ingestion. Stratified standard sampling techniques were used to determine the distribution of nutrients and parasites in a heterogeneous sward structure on the island of Hirta. St Kilda, which is grazed by a population of feral Soay sheep, The disparity bet between the short gap vegetation and the tall tussock vegetation was greatest in spring. when gap vegetation was some three-fold shorter than tussock vegetation; this led to tussocks offering greater nutrient and energy intake rate When compared to gap vegetation in spring. Parasites were concentrated in tussocks in spring. thus creating trade-offs. Such trade-offs were not present in summer Mien parasites were more evenly distributed across the gap tussock sward structure and the nutritional advantages associated with grazing tussocks were diminished. The diet selection of the resident Population of sheep was determined by recording the number of bites taken from gap and tussock vegetation by randomly selected focal animals over repeated 5-min grazing periods. Overall. all animals avoided grazing tussocks. Which were most strongly avoided in the spring. and older animals avoided grazing tussocks to a greater extent. Overall. females with lambs and males avoided tussocks to a similar degree and both avoided them less than barren females Faecal egg counts (FEC) of female sheep were negatively correlated with tussock selectivity and Nice versa for male sheep. The interaction between the grazing behaviour of each sex and FEC is discussed in relation to the immunocompetence and nutrient requirements of the different sexes, The maximum disparity between the costs and benefits of the trade-off studied occurred in late winter early spring which also represents the time of greatest nutrient demand in the soak sheep. since many are close to starvation and, or are in the advanced stages of pregnancy.

@article{grodio_pathogenicity_2012,
	Abstract = {Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) has become a common cause of conjunctivitis in free-living house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) since its emergence in the early 1990s. To date, temporal and spatial genotypic variation in MG has been documented, but phenotypic variation in pathogenicity and immunogenicity has not been examined. House finches were inoculated with MG isolates Virginia (VA)1994, California (CA)2006, or North Carolina (NC)2006, which were cultured from free-living house finches with conjunctivitis in 1994, 2006, and 2006, respectively. Infection with NC2006 resulted in the most severe eye lesions, highest pathogen loads, and highest levels of pathogen-specific lachrymal and serum antibodies. Infection with CA2006 caused the least severe eye lesions, lowest pathogen load, and lowest levels of antibodies. A small number of birds in each group developed protracted, severe disease in spite of robust antibody responses, suggesting that immunopathology may contribute to the lesions. Immunoblot analyses indicated that isolates are antigenically similar; thus, there may be partial cross-protection if a house finch encounters two or more strains of MG throughout the course of its lifetime. This study provides evidence that MG strains or strain variants circulating in house finch populations vary in their ability to cause disease, induce antibody responses, and persist in the host.

	Abstract = {Abomasal nematodes (Ostertagiine: Trichostrongyloidea) representing a previously unrecognized genus and species are reported in African buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) from Kenya, Uganda, and South Africa. Africanastrongylus buceros gen. nov. et sp. nov. is characterized by a symmetrical tapering synlophe in the cervical region and a maximum of 60 ridges in males and females. Bursal structure is 2-2-1, with subequal Rays 4/5, massive Rays 8, and Rays 9/10, and a massive dorsal lobe that is reduced in length, laterally and dorsally inflated, and positioned ventral to externodorsal rays. Spicules are tripartite, and the gubernaculum is broadly alate in the anterior. A proconus is present. Among ostertagiines with a 2-2-1 bursa (Cervicaprastrongylus, Hyostrongylus, Mazamastrongylus, Sarwaria, Spiculopteragia, and Teladorsagia) specimens of Africanastrongylus are differentiated from respective genera based on the structure of the cervical synlophe, patterns of dorsal, externodorsal, lateral, and ventral rays, and configuration of the genital cone, gubernaculum, and spicules. Among 13 genera of the Ostertagiinae in the global fauna, 3 are entirely limited in distribution to Africa, including Africanastrongylus, Longistrongylus, and Pseudomarshallagia. Another 5 genera including Cervicaprastrongylus, Hyostrongylus, Marshallagia, Ostertagia, and Teladorsagia are represented as mosaics, with diversity centered in Eurasia or the Holarctic. Genera not represented in the African fauna include Camelostrongylus among Caprinae and some Antelopinae from Eurasia, Mazamastrongylus and Spiculopteragia in Cervidae from the Holarctic and Eurasia, respectively, Orloffia in Cervidae and Bovidae from the Holarctic, and Sarwaria among Tragulidae and Bovinae in southern Asia. The diverse nature of the ostertagiine fauna, with a disproportionate number of endemic genera relative to other regions of the northern hemisphere, may reflect the timing of episodic expansion events for artiodactyls into Africa from Eurasia during the Tertiary and Quaternary.},

Although many methods for assessing animal body condition have been developed, relatively few can be used for estimating condition on live animals. Noninvasive body condition scoring techniques have been developed for assessing condition in livestock and more recently such techniques have been applied to wild ungulates. In this study, we examined the reliability of a body condition scoring technique for assessing condition in African buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer). We compared a body condition score (BCS) based on visual assessment and manual palpation of an animal's body to two standard metrics of condition widely used in mammals: kidney fat index (KFI) and haematocrit (HCT). Across all buffalo, BCS was significantly and positively correlated with both KFI and HCT. For HCT, this pattern was observed among adults, juveniles, males and females; and in the wet season but not in the dry season. For KFI, BCS was significantly and positively correlated with KFI among adults, juveniles and males, but not in females. Overall, our results suggest that the BCS technique can serve as a useful method for estimating body condition in buffalo.},

@article{hoef_quasi-poisson_2007,
	Abstract = {Quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression models have equal numbers of parameters, and either could be used for overdispersed count data. While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasi-Poisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

	Abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Although behaviours can contribute to the heterogeneity in parasite load among hosts, links between consistent individual differences in behaviour and parasitic infection have received little attention. We investigated the role of host activity and exploration on hard tick infestations of marked individuals in a population of Siberian chipmunks Tamias sibiricus introduced in a suburban French forest over 3 years. 2. Individual activity-exploration profiles were assessed from 106 hole-board tests on 73 individuals, and chipmunks' trappability and trap diversity were used respectively as indices of their activity-exploration and space use on a sub-sample of 60 individuals. At each capture, we counted the total number of ticks per head of chipmunk. 3. We found significant and consistent individual differences in activity-exploration, trappability, trap diversity and tick load, and could estimate individual indices for these four variables, corrected for confounding effects of year, season, body mass and sex. 4. Using a path analysis, we found an indirect effect of activity-exploration on tick load: tick load increased with space use, which in turn was positively affected by trappability in the field. Trappability was itself positively related to activity-exploration in the hole board. Habitat type affected tick load, independently of behavioural traits. A second path model revealed a lack of either direct or indirect influence of tick loads on chipmunks' personality and trappability. 5. Our results show that host personality-related patterns in space use can lead to a non-random parasite distribution among hosts.},

@article{cattadori_parasite_2008,
	Abstract = {We examined the hypothesis that the interaction between concomitant infecting parasites modifies host susceptibility, parasite inten- sity and the pattern of parasite distribution within the host population. We used a 26 year time series of three common parasites in a natural population of rabbits: two gastrointestinal nematodes (Trichostrongylus retortaeformis and Graphidium strigosum) and the immu- nosuppressive myxoma virus. The frequency distribution of nematodes in the host population and the relationship between host age and nematode intensity were explored in rabbits with either single or dual nematode infections and rabbits infected with the nematodes and myxoma virus. The aggregation of T. retortaeformis and G. strigosum among the rabbits varied with the nature of the co-infection both in male and female hosts. The two nematodes exhibited different age--intensity profiles: G. strigosum intensity increased exponentially with host age while T. retortaeformis intensity exhibited a convex shape. The presence of a secondary infection did not change the age--inten- sity profile for G. strigosum but for T. retortaeformis co-infection (either both nematodes or myxoma-nematodes) resulted in significantly greater intensities in adult hosts. Results suggest that multi-species infections contributed to aggregation of parasites in the host popu- lation and to seasonal variation in intensity, but also enhanced differences in parasitism between sexes. This effect was apparent for T. retortaeformis, which appears to elicit a strong acquired immune response but not for G. strigosum which does not produce any evident immune reaction. We concluded that concomitant infections mediated by host immunity are important in modifying host susceptibility and influencing heterogeneity amongst individual hosts.},

@article{hawley_disease_2011,
	Abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Ecological immunology and disease ecology are two relatively young disciplines that apply ecological approaches and principles to traditionally non-ecological fields. In both cases, an ecological perspective has allowed new insights to emerge by focusing attention on variation over space and time, and by emphasizing the role of the environment in shaping individual responses and the outcome of host-pathogen interactions. Here we review the growing conceptual interface between these two rapidly evolving fields. 2. Areas of synergy between ecological immunology and disease ecology aim to translate variation in within-host processes (e.g. immunity) into between-host dynamics (e.g. parasite transmission). Emerging areas of synergy include potential immune mechanisms that underlie host heterogeneity in disease susceptibility, teasing apart the effects of environmental factors such as seasonality and climate on host susceptibility and pathogen dynamics, and predicting the outcome of co-infection by functionally distinct groups of parasites that elicit different immune responses. 3. In some cases, practical limitations have constrained the merging of ideas in ecological immunology and disease ecology. We discuss several logistical challenges, including dissecting the relative roles of host exposure and susceptibility, establishing links between measures of immunity and pathogen resistance in wild populations, and incorporating relevant immune variation into prevailing disease ecology modeling frameworks. 4. Future work at the interface of these two fields should advance understanding of life-history theory, host-pathogen dynamics, and physiological ecology, and will also contribute to targeted approaches for wildlife health and zoonotic disease prevention.},

@article{cattadori_peak_2005,
	Abstract = {Insight into the dynamics of parasite-host relationships of higher vertebrates requires an understanding of two important features: the nature of transmission and the development of acquired immunity in the host. A dominant hypothesis proposes that acquired immunity develops with the cumulative exposure to infection, and consequently predicts a negative relationship between peak intensity of infection and host age at this peak. Although previous studies have found evidence to support this hypothesis through between-population comparisons, these results are confounded by spatial effects. In this study, we examined the dynamics of infection of the nematode Trichostrongylus retortaeformis within a natural population of rabbits sampled monthly for 26 years. The rabbit age structure was reconstructed using body mass as a proxy for age, and the host age-parasite intensity relationship was examined for each rabbit cohort born from February to August. The age-intensity curves exhibited a typical concave shape, and a significant negative relationship was found between peak intensity of infection and host age at this peak. Adult females showed a distinct periparturient rise in T retortaeformis infection, with higher intensities in breeding adult females than adult males and non-breeding females. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of an acquired immune response of the host to a parasite infection, supporting the principle that acquired immunity can be modelled using the cumulative exposure to infection. These findings also show that seasonality can be an important driver of host-parasite interactions.},

This paper reports the first epidemiological study of the protozoan species comprising Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia duodenalis and 11 species of Eimeria in Soay sheep across 3 years of varying host population density. Prevalence and intensity of almost all species of protozoa significantly decreased with host age, with the exception of E. granulosa, which increased in prevalence with host age. The prevalence of C. parvum appeared to vary positively with host population density but that of G. duodenalis did not vary significantly with density. Most species of Eimeria showed a distinct lag in infection level following the host population crash of 2002, taking up to 2 years to decrease. Mixed Eimeria species intensity and diversity were highest in 2002, a year of low host density. Parasite diversity decreased with host age and was higher in males. There were 5 positive pair-wise associations between protozoa species in terms of prevalence. The results of this study highlight the potential for protozoal infection to shape the evolution of parasite resistance in wild host populations harbouring diverse parasite species.},

	Abstract = {The epidemiology of nematode infections of Soay sheep on the island of St Kilda over a period of 2 years (August 1988-August 1990) spanning a host population crash is described. Infective larvae (L3) levels on pasture were high (2422 +/- 365 L3/kg D.M. grass in midsummer 1988) when host population density was high, decreasing after the sheep population declined by 70 \% in early 1989 (601 +/- 14 L3/kg D.M. in midsummer 1989). The availability of infective larvae to sheep increased during the winter of 1988-1989, probably as a result of concentration of existing larvae on grass as vegetation was destroyed by bad weather and overgrazing. Increased availability of pre-parasitic stages was accompanied by a marked increased in faecal egg counts from sheep of all ages and both sexes. Prevalence and intensity of infection (faecal egg counts) were higher in males than females throughout the 2-year study (chi2 = 208.3, P {\textless} 0.005 and F1,2000 = 304, P {\textless} 0.001 respectively), except during the lambing periods, and decreased with age in both sexes. Changes in prevalence and intensity of strongyle infections were associated with changes in host population density. Prevalence and intensity of Dictyocaulus filaria larvae in faeces increased during the host population crash. Infection intensity decreased with age (F1,203 = 44.02, P {\textless} 0.001) and was higher in males than females (F1,203 = 13.45, P {\textless} 0.001).},

	Abstract = {Host-parasite dynamics can be strongly affected by seasonality and age-related host immune responses. We investigated how observed variation in the prevalence and intensity of parasite egg or oocyst shedding in four co-occurring ungulate species may reflect underlying seasonal variation in transmission and host immunity. This study was conducted July 2005 October 2006 in Etosha National Park, Namibia, using indices of parasitism recorded from 1,022 fecal samples collected from plains zebra (Equus quagga), springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis), blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), and gemsbok (Onyx gazella). The presence and intensity of strongyle nematodes, Strongyloides spp. and Eimeria spp. parasites, were strongly seasonal for most host-parasite combinations, with more hosts infected in the wet season than the dry season. Strongyle intensity in zebra was significantly lower in juveniles than adults, and in springbok hosts, Eimeria spp. intensity was significantly greater in juveniles than adults. These results provide evidence that acquired immunity is less protective against strongyle nematodes than Eimeria spp. infections. The seasonal patterns in parasitism further indicate that the long dry season may limit development and survival of parasite stages in the environment and, as a result, host contact and parasite transmission.},

	Abstract = {Between April 2008 and March 2009, we analyzed the pattern of coccidian oocysts present in the feces of the European bison (Bison bonasus L., 1758) and found 4 species (Eimeria bovis, E. (canadensis, E. ellipsoidalis, E. zuernii) previously reported from this host and 3 species (Eimeria alabamensis, E. cylindrica, E. pellita) that are new host and locality records. All the species occurred in bison females, and only 4 occurred in males; E. bovis was the most prevalent in both sexes. The overall prevalence of Eimeria spp. invasion reached 34.7\% in cows and 13.9\% in bulls. The highest prevalence was noted in early spring, with a peak in April, and the lowest in late autumn and winter. The oocyst count per gram of feces (OPG) varied from 50 to 1,350; no symptoms of clinical coccidiosis were observed. We found a significant influence of winter aggregations of bison on shedding of coccidian oocysts. The prevalence and OPG values were higher in bison congregating in large numbers around winter-feeding sites in comparison to other sites. We suggest that the coming together of cows during the growing season impacts the gender-related differences in prevalence and the number of coccidian species involved. This observation probably results from an increased production of oocysts by sub-clinically infected individuals in high-density bison populations.},

@article{cote_resistance_2005,
	Abstract = {Resistance to parasites is believed to have a widespread influence on demographic and adaptive processes. In systems where parasites impose a fitness cost on their host, heterozygotes may be selected because they are more resistant to parasites than homozygotes. Our objective was to assess the relationships between genomewide individual heterozygosity and abomasal nematode burdens in female Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) after the effects of host age, locality, season, and year had been accounted for. Samples were obtained from 306 female reindeer that were culled and genotyped at nine microsatellite loci. Reindeer in our study populations are mainly parasitized by the gastrointestinal nematodes Ostertagia gruehneri and Marshallagia marshalli. The infection intensity of each parasite differed between subpopulations, and among host age classes, seasons and years. We found no significant relationships between abomasal worm burdens, or lumen and mucosa larvae, of either O. gruehneri or M. marshalli and individual heterozygosity ( or mean d(2)) alone or in interactions with host age, locality, and year. Although we analysed one of the largest data set available to date on gastrointestinal nematodes of a wild ruminant, we used a typical data set of nine genetic neutral markers that may have had low power to detect heterozygosity-fitness correlations. We conclude that the proportion of the variance in parasite resistance explained by individual heterozygosity for neutral genetic markers is low in Svalbard reindeer and in vertebrates in general, and we suggest that the candidate-gene approach might be more fruitful for further research on gene-fitness correlations.},

	Abstract = {The evolution and maintenance of elaborate secondary sexual characters in males have been the subject of intense interest since Darwin's time. Parasite-mediated sexual selection (PMSS) suggests that elaborate ornaments serve as honest indicators of male health and parasite resistance. Studies testing this key prediction of PMSS have largely focused on ornaments, with the role parasites might play in the maintenance of elaborate weapons being relatively understudied. Here, we tested whether weapon (horn) size was an indicator of health status in male and female African buffalo, Syncerus caffer. We examined whether individuals with larger horns were less likely to be infected with parasites, and had lower parasite loads and stronger immune systems. In males, horn size was significantly negatively correlated with the number of different parasites infecting an individual (parasite richness), the likelihood of infection with strongyle nematodes and coccidia, and strongyle intensity. In females, horn size was significantly negatively correlated with parasite richness, occurrence of coccidia infection, coccidia intensity and white blood cell count. These findings were robust when the effects of body condition, age and season were controlled for, consistent with the idea that horns function as honest indicators of health in both sexes. Our study provides new insight into the evolution and maintenance of elaborate weapons in mammals, suggesting a role for PMSS in both males and females.},

@article{work_microparasite_2010,
	Abstract = {Common bluestriped snappers Lutjanus kasmira were intentionally introduced into Hawaii from the South Pacific in the 1950s and have become well established throughout the archipelago. We examined health, prevalence and infection intensity of 2 microparasites, coccidia and epitheliocystis-like organisms (ELO), in L. kasmira from their introduced and native range including the islands where translocated fish originated (Tahiti and Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia) and from several other islands (American Samoa, Fiji and New Caledonia). In addition, we did a longitudinal survey of these parasites in the introduced range. Coccidia and ELO were widely distributed and were found on all islands except for New Caledonia. Health indices, as measured by overall organ lesions, body condition and parasite intensity, indicated that fish from Samoa were the least healthy, and fish from Midway (Hawaiian Archipelago) were the healthiest. Microparasite diversity was highest on Midway and Hawaii and lowest on New Caledonia. Infection of coccidia followed an asymptotic size prevalence curve, whereas that of ELO peaked at larger size classes (27.8 cm). Prevalence and aggregation of both parasites in the host varied dynamically over 8 yr, with prevalence and aggregation of coccidia being consistently higher and lower, respectively, than ELO. We hypothesize that these parasites are enzootic to the Hawaiian Islands and were not introduced with fish from Tahiti or the Marquesas Islands. Host response and aggregation parameters suggest that coccidia exert a negative effect on their host and probably have an indirect life cycle, whereas ELO appears less pathogenic and has a direct life cycle.},

	Abstract = {We assessed the effect of two pathogens (myxoma virus and Eimeria stiedae) and five macroparasites (gastrointestinal helminth species) of the wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) upon total host body mass and abdominal fat level. Additionally, we assessed the effects of these organisms on the number of foetuses in adult females during the peak breeding period. Both mass of abdominal fat and total body mass of the rabbit were negatively associated with myxoma virus infection and increasing helminth species richness. Total body mass was also negatively associated with the protozoan parasite E. steidae. No relationship was found between any of the parasites/pathogens and the number of foetuses in adult females, although only relatively small sample sizes were available for this section of the analysis. Increasing host body mass was positively associated with number of foetuses and we propose that mass reduction caused by the pathogen and parasite species could also have the consequence of reducing foetal number.

@article{davis_snake_2012,
	Abstract = {Urban-associated changes can have immediate or long-term consequences on animal populations. Such changes may be assessed through parasite prevalence and abundance in wildlife hosts, as urbanization can influence parasitism and disease transmission in wildlife. Snakes are widespread and diverse vertebrates that often persist in urban environments; however, parasitism of snakes in urban environments has yet to be studied, leaving the roles of snakes in parasite transmission uncharacterized. Field ecology, microscopy, molecular techniques, and geographic information science (GIS) were integrated to characterize parasitism of snakes in an urban old-growth forest park. The species, sex, mass, length, location, and prevalence of ecto-, hemo-, and fecal parasites were determined for 34 snakes of 6 species. Ectoparasites (mite), hemoparasites (Hepatozoon spp.), and fecal parasites (Entamoeba spp., Trichomonas spp., Strongloides spp., and an unidentified helminth) were detected in snakes and 64.7 \% of snakes were infected by at least one of these parasites. Parasite infections were generally not related to the sex, age, or body condition of snakes. The locations of infected snakes were used to produce risk maps indicating where parasite prevalence is predicted to be greatest. The analysis of these maps indicated that snakes with fecal parasites were closer than non-infected snakes to the edge of the forest. This study confirms that snakes may be important parasite hosts or reservoirs in parasite transmission pathways in urban environments and it provides an integrative multidisciplinary approach that may be used to monitor parasitism dynamics in other urban wildlife areas.},

@article{martin_seasonal_2008,
	Abstract = {Animals living in temporally dynamic environments experience variation in resource availability, climate and threat of infection over the course of the year. Thus, to survive and reproduce successfully, these organisms must allocate resources among competing physiological systems in such a way as to maximize fitness in changing environments. Here, we review evidence supporting the hypothesis that physiological trade-offs, particularly those between the reproductive and immune systems, mediate part of the seasonal changes detected in the immune defences of many vertebrates. Abundant recent work has detected significant energetic and nutritional costs of immune defence. Sometimes these physiological costs are sufficiently large to affect fitness (e.g. reproductive output, growth or survival), indicating that selection for appropriate allocation strategies probably occurred in the past. Because hormones often orchestrate allocations among physiological systems, the endocrine mediators of seasonal changes in immune activity are discussed. Many hormones, including melatonin, glucocorticoids and androgens have extensive and consistent effects on the immune system, and they change in systematic fashions over the year. Finally, a modified framework within which to conduct future studies in ecological immunology is proposed, viz. a heightened appreciation of the complex but intelligible nature of the vertebrate immune system. Although other factors besides trade- offs undoubtedly influence seasonal variation in immune defence in animals, a growing literature supports a role for physiological trade-offs and the fitness consequences they sometimes produce.},

@article{ezenwa_interactions_2004,
	Abstract = {In this study, I explored the interactions among host diet, nutritional status and gastrointestinal parasitism in wild bovids by examining temporal patterns of nematode faecal egg shedding in species with different diet types during a drought and non-drought year. Study species included three grass and roughage feeders (buffalo, hartebeest, waterbuck), four mixed or intermediate feeders (eland, Grant's gazelle, impala, Thomson's gazelle) and two concentrate selectors (dik-dik, klipspringer). Six out of the nine focal species had higher mean faecal egg counts in the drought year compared to the normal year, and over the course of the dry year, monthly faecal egg counts were correlated with drought intensity in four species with low-quality diets, but no such relationship was found for species with high-quality diets. Comparisons of dietary crude protein and faecal egg count in impala showed that during the dry season, individuals with high faecal egg counts (\$1550 eggs/g of faeces) had significantly lower crude protein levels than individuals with low (0--500 eggs/g) or moderate (550--1500 eggs/g) egg counts. These results suggest that under drought conditions, species unable to maintain adequate nutrition, mainly low-quality feeders, are less able to cope with gastrointestinal parasite infections. In particular, during dry periods, reduced protein intake seems to be associated with declining resilience and resistance to infection.},

@article{martin_investment_2006,
	Abstract = {The evidence for a relationship between life history and immune defense is equivocal, although the basic premise is intuitively appealing: animals that live short lives and reproduce early and rapidly should not waste resources on defenses they might never use. One possible reason for a lack of strong support for this hypothesis could be the inherent complexity of the ver- tebrate immune system. Indeed, different components of the vertebrate immune system vary in their relative costs and benefits, and therefore only some defenses may complement variation in species' life history. To address this hypothesis, we compared multiple types of immune activity between two populations of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) with distinct life histories, one from Colon, Panama, which lay small clutches over an ex- tended breeding season (i.e., slow-living) and the other from Princeton, New Jersey, which lay larger clutches in a smaller window of time (i.e., fast-living). We expected (a) that more costly types of immune defenses would be stronger in the slow-living sparrows and (2) that the slow-living sparrows would show a greater increase in whole-body energy expenditure after immune challenge compared to their fast-living counterparts. We found that secondary antibody response to a novel antigen was more rapid and energetic investment in immune activity was greater in slow-living sparrows. However, cell-mediated immune activity was more robust in fast-living sparrows, and other measures of defense were not dif- ferent between populations. These results provide partial support for a relationship between life history and im- mune defense in this species, but they also indicate that this relationship is not clear-cut. Further study is nec- essary to identify the influence of other factors, partic- ular pathogen environment during development, on the architecture of the immune system of wild animals.},

@article{ander_regulation_nodate,
	Abstract = {(1) Several models describing the dynamics of host-parasite associations are discussed.
(2) The models contain the central assumption that the parasite increases the rate of host mortalities. The parasite induced changes in this rate are formulated as functions of the parasite numbers per host and hence of the statistical distribution of the parasites within the host population.
(3) The parameters influencing the ability of the parasite to regulate the growth of its host's population, and the stability of parasite induced equilibria, are examined for each model.
(4) Three specific categories of population processes are shown to be of particular significance in stabilizing the dynamical behaviour of host-parasite interactions and enhancing the regulatory role of the parasite.
These categories are overdispersion of parasite numbers per host, nonlinear functional relationships between parasite burden per host and host death rate, and density depen- dent constraints on parasite population growth within individual hosts.},

@article{honer_impact_2012,
	Abstract = {1. The long-term ecological impact of pathogens on group-living, large mammal populations is largely unknown. We evaluated the impact of a pathogenic bacterium, Streptococcus equi rumi- natorum, and other key ecological factors on the dynamics of the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta population in the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania.
2. We compared key demographic parameters during two years when external signs of bacterial infection were prevalent (`outbreak') and periods of five years before and after the outbreak when such signs were absent or rare. We also tested for density dependence and calculated the basic reproductive rate R0 of the bacterium.
3. Duringthefivepre-outbreakyears,themeanannualhyenamortalityratewas0{\AE}088,andannual population growth was relatively high (13{\AE}6\%). During the outbreak, mortality increased by 78\% to a rate of 0{\AE}156, resulting in an annual population decline of 4{\AE}3\%. After the outbreak, popula- tion size increased moderately (5{\AE}1\%) during the first three post-outbreak years before resuming a growth similar to pre-outbreak levels (13{\AE}9\%). We found no evidence that these demographic changes were driven by density dependence or other ecological factors.
4. Mosthyenasshowedsignsofinfectionwhenpreyabundanceintheirterritorywaslow.During the outbreak, mortality increased among adult males and yearlings, but not among adult females -- the socially dominant group members. These results suggest that infection and mortality were modulated by factors linked to low social status and poor nutrition. During the outbreak, we esti- mated R0 for the bacterium to be 2{\AE}7, indicating relatively fast transmission.
5. Our results suggest that the short-term `top--down' impact of S. equi ruminatorum during the outbreak was driven by `bottom--up' effects on nutritionally disadvantaged age--sex classes, whereas the longer-term post-outbreak reduction in population growth was caused by poor survival of juve- niles during the outbreak and subsequent poor recruitment of breeding females. These results suggest synergistic effects of `bottom--up' and `top--down' processes on host population dynamics.},

	Abstract = {To evaluate non-chemical strategies to control pasture-borne parasites in first-season grazing (FSG) cattle, a 3-year grazing trial was conducted during 2002-2004 on naturally infected pastures on a commercial beef cattle farm in Sweden. A uniform pasture was divided in 4 equal 2 ha paddocks onto each of which 10, 5-9 months old dairy breed steer calves were allocated at turn-out in May each year. Two strategies were evaluated: (1) turn-out onto pasture which had been grazed the previous year by second-season grazing (SSG) steers, followed by a move to aftermath in mid-July (RT) and (2) supplementation with concentrate and roughage for 4 weeks from turn-out (FD). Comparisons were made with an untreated (UT), and an anthelmintic treated control group (DO). Animal parasitology and performance were monitored monthly throughout the 20 weeks grazing period. Additional sampling occasions were performed on day 9 (for coccidia) and 10 weeks after turn-out (mid-July). Due to clinical parasitic gastro-enteritis (PGE), salvage treatments were performed on all animals in group FD approximately 7 weeks after turn-out in 2003 and of three animals in group UT5 weeks after turn-out in 2004. In 2003, the geometric mean oocyst excretion 9 days after turn-out was approximately 150,000 opg of mainly Eimeria alabamensis in group FD, and in 2004 approximately 180,000 opg in group UT. Apart from the DO group, geometric mean faecal egg counts (FEC) were between 80 and 400 epg 4 weeks after turn-out. Mean serum pepsinogen concentrations (SPC) of approximately 3.6 U tyrosine were recorded in the FD and UT groups from late August 2002. In 2003 and 2004, mean concentrations in these groups were between 4.1 and 7.2 U tyrosine 8 weeks after turn-out. By the end of the three grazing seasons the average weight gain difference compared to the DO group was for FD -29, -38 and -5 kg and for RT -4, -21 and +14 kg, and compared to the UT group -18 +2 and +22 for FD and +7, +19 and +41 kg for group RT. In conclusion, the rotation control strategy showed promising results, whereas the strategic feeding was poor from a parasite control standpoint.},

	Abstract = {A survey of gastrointestinal parasite infections of young (56 months old), immature (6{\textasciicircum}12 months old) and adult (412 months old) dairy cattle on 16 farms in Kiambu District, Kenya was conducted during a dry season (September 1991 to January 1992) and during a wet season (March to July 1992). The survey was based on monthly coproparasitological examination of cohorts and worm counts in tracer calves. The e{!'}ects of age, sex, farm and season on the prevalence and intensity of helminth and coccidial infections were determined. Faecal egg and oocyst counts revealed that the overall prevalences were: strongyles (including trichostrongyles) (85.5\%), liver £ukes (Fasciola gigantica) (34.0\%), coccidia (30.9\%) and tapeworms (9.6\%). Eight species of the protozoan Eimeria were identi¢ed, the most prevalent species being E. bovis and E. zuernii. The most prevalent nematode genera were Haemonchus, Cooperia, Oesophagostomum and Trichostrongylus. Season, farm and age of the animals had a signi¢cant (p50.05) in£uence on the intensity of infection with strongyles, liver £ukes and coccidia, whereas the sex of the animals had no signi¢cant (p40.05) e{!'}ect on the prevalence or intensity of infections. A higher intensity of infection with strongyles and coccidia was found in the wet season than in the dry season (p50.05). The age-speci¢c intensity was in the following order: for strongyles, immature animals of 6{\textasciicircum}12 months of age had the highest egg counts, followed by young calves and adults. Calves had signi¢cantly (p50.05) higher oocyst counts than immatures or adults. Liver £uke egg counts did not di{!'}er signi¢cant (p40.05) between immatures and adult cattle.},

	Abstract = {Even though theoretical models show that parasites may regulate host population densities, few empirical studies have given support to this hypothesis. We present experimental and observational evidence for a host-parasite interaction where the parasite has sufficient impact on host population dynamics for regulation to occur. During a six year study of the Svalbard reindeer and its parasitic gastrointestinal nematode Ostertagia gruehneri we found that anthelminthic treatment in April-May increased the probability of a reindeer having a calf in the next year, compared with untreated controls. However, treatment did not influence the over-winter survival of the reindeer. The annual variation in the degree to which parasites depressed fecundity was positively related to the abundance of O. gruehneri infection the previous October, which in turn was related to host density two years earlier. In addition to the treatment effect, there was a strong negative effect of winter precipitation on the probability of female reindeer having a calf. A simple matrix model was parameterized using estimates from our experimental and observational data. This model shows that the parasite-mediated effect on fecundity was sufficient to regulate reindeer densities around observed host densities.},

@article{hayes_immune-mediated_2004,
	Abstract = {Gastrointestinal nematode infection is extremely prevalent worldwide in humans and animals. Infection levels vary between individuals in infected populations and exhibit a negative binomial distribution, and some individuals appear to be predisposed to certain infection levels. Moreover, infection tends to be chronic, despite evidence for the acquisition of some degree of acquired immunity. The host is subject to constant and repeated antigenic challenge, and individuals vary in the response they make. While a considerable amount of information is emerging on the immunoregulatory mechanisms operating during acute nematode infection from a variety of laboratory model systems, relatively little work has been carried out on the immune mechanisms underlying chronic infection. This review details some of the work that has addressed this important facet of gut nematode infection, highlighting studies from model systems that give insight into the induction of nonprotective immunity, while at the same time avoiding the induction of host-damaging pathology.},

@article{sinclair_resource_1975,
	Abstract = {(1) Three tropical grassland systems were examined in the Serengeti region of Tanzania with respect to changes in grass off-take by ungulates, small mammals and grasshoppers, within the annual cycle. These groups comprised most of the herbivore trophic level. (2) Within all three grassland systems there was, on average, a short period of one to four months during the dry season when available food was lower than the requirements of the herbivore trophic level. Such a shortage would be sufficient to limit the herbivore populations. (3) The limiting resource was the green component of the primary production during the dry season. At this time it was sufficiently low in abundance to be affected by the density of grazing herbivores. (4) Because grasses are dormant when grazing is greatest, and can recover quickly from the impact of grazing, this vegetation-herbivore system was potentially stable. (5) The temporary shortage of the food component of the primary production limiting the herbivores could be a feature common to all terrestrial vegetation-herbivore systems. (6) Since both primary and tertiary trophic levels must also be resource limited, this work suggests that all trophic levels may be limited by their resources.},

According to survival times after inoculation of 10(5) CFU intravenously (i.v.), the mice could be classified as being either highly susceptible (CBA, DBA/2. C3H, 129/SvJ) or highly resistant (BALB/c and C57BL/6). F-1 hybrids of susceptible and resistant strains were resistant. Although an examination of a limited number of H-2 congenic strains showed that the H-2(k) haplotype could confer susceptibility on a resistant strain, it was evident that non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes were much more important. Resistant strains all possessed the susceptibility allele of the anti-microbial resistance gene, Nramp1. Results obtained with selected strains infected with 10(2) CFU of M. tuberculosis by aerosol agreed with the results obtained with mice infected i.v. The size of the bacterial inoculum was important in distinguishing between resistant and susceptible strains, in that a 10(7) inoculum overcame the resistance advantage of one strain over another.},

	Abstract = {Variation in the environment is common within and between natural populations and may influence selection on plant resistance by altering the level of damage or the fitness consequences of damage from plant enemies. While Much is known about how environmental variation influences the amount of damage a plant experiences, few studies have attempted to determine how variation in the environment may alter the fitness consequences of damage, particularly in plant-pathogen interactions. In this work we manipulated a rust pathogen, Coleosporium ipomoeae, in field experiments and showed that this pathogen reduced several components of fitness in its natural host plant, Ipomoea purpurea. Furthermore, we showed that the deleterious effects of C. ipomoeae were variable. We identified variation in the quality of a plant's microenvironment, the abundance of secondary enemy damage, and the length of a growing season as variable components of the environment that may influence the magnitude of damage and tolerance, causing the interaction between C. ipomoeae and L purpurea to vary from parasitism to commensalism. Considering how environmental variation impacts the magnitude and negative fitness effects of pathogen damage is important to understanding spatially variable selection and coevolution in this and other plant-pathogen interactions.},

@article{macandza_forage_2004,
	Abstract = {Forage selection by buffalo and the contribution of grass species to buffalo diet were investigated by comparing two herds occupying granite and basalt landscapes in the Kruger National Park. Observations spanned the late dry season, from July to October 2002. Grass remained greener in bottomlands than in midslopes or uplands within each landscape, but greenness was not significantly different between the basalt and granite landscapes. The favoured grass species remaining highly acceptable to buffalo throughout the late dry season included Panicum maximum, Panicum coloratum, Cenchrus ciliaris and Heteropogon contortus. However, the dietary contribution by these species declined with the progress of the dry season owing to a reduction in the available forage that they retained. The acceptance frequency as well as the dietary contribution of Urochloa mosambicensis, Digitaria eriantha and Eragrostis superba increased over time, while Bothriochloa spp. became moderately acceptable at the end of the dry season in October. Themeda triandra, a species highly rated as forage for cattle, appeared intermediate in its acceptability to buffalo and made a relatively small dietary contribution in both landscapes. In accordance with foraging theory, buffalo expanded the range of grass species accepted, changed the proportions of grass species in their diet and shifted their grazing locations within the landscape.},

@article{mutanga_explaining_2004,
	Abstract = {The search for possible factors influencing the spatial variation of grass quality is an important step towards understanding the distribution of herbivores, as well as a step towards identifying crucial areas for conservation and restoration. A number of studies have shown that grass quality at a regional scale is influenced by climatic variables. At a local scale, site factors and their interaction are considered important. In this study, we aimed at examining environmental correlates of grass quality at a local scale. The study also sought to establish if biotic factors interact significantly with abiotic factors in influencing a variation in grass quality. 

Location The study area is located in the Kruger National Park of South Africa. The study area stretches from west (22degrees49' S and 31degrees01' E) to east, (22degrees44' S and 31degrees22' E) covering an area of about 25 x 6 km in the far northern region of the Kruger National Park. 

Methods We collected environmental data such as soil texture, percentage grass cover and biomass as well as grass samples for chemical analysis from specific locations in the study area. In addition, a digital elevation model (DEM) with a resolution of 5 m was used to derive elevation, slope and aspect using a geographic information system (GIS), which were related to grass quality. We used correlation analysis and {\textless}smallcapitals{\textgreater}anova{\textless}/smallcapitals{\textgreater} to relate environmental variables to grass quality. Multivariate analysis techniques were used to simultaneously analyse and explore the complex interactions between variables. 

Results and conclusions Our results indicate that there is a significant relationship between grass quality parameters and site-specific factors such as slope, altitude, percentage grass cover, aspect and soil texture. Relatively, percentage grass cover and soil texture were more critical in explaining a variation in grass quality. Plant characteristics such as species type interact significantly with slope, altitude and geology in influencing nutrient distribution. The results of this study may give a better insight on foliar nutrient distribution patterns at a landscape scale in savanna rangelands. Furthermore, the results of this study may help in the selection of ancillary information, which could be used in conjunction with other data such as remotely sensed data to map grass quality - an important step towards understanding the distribution and feeding patterns of wildlife. However, we acknowledge that this study is based on one seasonal snapshot, therefore some slightly different findings may be obtained during other times of the year. Nevertheless, the study has revealed that under the conditions experienced during the study period, nutrient distribution varies with varying biotic and abiotic factors.},

	Abstract = {Bovine brucellosis, caused by the bacterium Brucella abortus, is endemic in bison (Bison bison) and elk (Germs elaphus nelsoni) populations in the area of Yellowstone. National Park, USA. Two strategies have been proposed to reduce the risk of transmission, of disease in bison remote vaccination with the vaccine RB51, and the use of immunocontraception of bison to decrease shedding of organisms from infected females. The frequent occurrence of venereal transmission in bison would complicate either of these strategies, requiring vaccination of males as well as females, and rendering immunocontraception less effective in reducing transmission of B. abortus. To address the question of venereal transmission, we inoculated each of 18 bison cows with 4.5 X 10(8) colony-forming units of B. abortus strain 19, as a surrogate of field strain, by three routes: intraconjunctival (IC), intravaginal (VI), and intracervical/intrauterine (AI). Bison semen was mixed with strain 19 inoculum for the latter route. Bison were monitored by serology and culture for 12 wk, at which time they were euthanized and specimens collected for culture. All IC-inoculated animals seroconverted on multiple tests and one was culture positive at 12 wk postexposure. Seven of eight VI bison developed suspect or positive serologic tests and four were positive at one or more time points. Weak transient serologic responses (suspect) were seen in four of five AI bison. Results showed that IC inoculation with strain 19 was a suitable surrogate for field strain to demonstrate exposure to the B. abortus. The seroconversion of four of eight VI bison indicated exposure of the immune system to the agent and the need for further studies on venereal transmission in bison.},

	Abstract = {1. Disease management along the boundaries of wildlife reserves is a growing conservation problem worldwide, as infected wildlife can migrate outside protected areas and pose a threat to livestock and human health. The bison Bison bison population in Yellowstone National Park has long been infected with Brucella abortus, but culling of Yellowstone bison to prevent transmission to cattle has been ineffective at reducing brucellosis infection. This management strategy is negatively affecting long-term bison conservation because of difficulties in diagnosing actively infected animals. 2. We integrated age-specific serology and B. abortus culture results from slaughtered Yellowstone bison to estimate probabilities of active brucellosis infection using a Bayesian framework. Infection probabilities were associated with age in young bison (0-5 years old) and with elevated antibody levels in older bison ({\textgreater} 5 years old). Our results indicate that Yellowstone bison acquire B. abortus infection early in life but typically recover as they grow older. 3. A tool was developed to allow bison management to better reflect the probability that particular animals are infective, with the aim of conserving Yellowstone bison while reducing the risk of brucellosis transmission to cattle. Combining selective removal of infectious bison with additional management practices, such as vaccination, has the potential to advance an effective brucellosis reduction programme. 4. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that active B. abortus infection in Yellowstone bison is age dependent, which allows true infection probabilities to be estimated based on age and quantitative diagnostic tests. These findings have important application to disease management worldwide where accurate diagnostic tests for wildlife are unavailable. Estimation of true infection probabilities can replace culling practices that conflict with wildlife conservation. The ability to identify infective individuals can improve management practices that support conservation, particularly when human health is at risk or endangered wildlife species are involved.},

	Abstract = {Our objective in this prospective study was to determine the natural course of Brucella abortus; infection in cohorts of seropositive and seronegative, female bison (Bison bison) and their offspring in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) for 5 yr. We collected specimens from 53 adult females and 25 calves at least once and from 45 adults and 22 calves more than once. Annual seroconversion rates (negative to positive) were relatively high (23\% for calves and juvenile bison, 6\% in the total sample of adult female bison in our study, and 11\% in the adult females that began the study as seronegatives). Antibody was not protective against infection, even for calves that passively received antibody from all infected mother's colostrum. Antibody levels staved remarkably constant, with only a slow decline over time. We found only two seroconversions from a weak positive status to negative. Infected bison aborted and shed viable bacteria. Risk of shedding infective Brucella was highest for bison ill the 2 yr following seroconversion from negative to positive. In one bison, we detected shedding for 3 yr following seroconversion. Regardless of serostatus of dams and neonates, most calves were seronegative by 5 mo of age. There was no relationship between the antibody status of the dam and the tendency of a calf to seroconvert to positive during the duration of the study.},

	Abstract = {1. Bison (Bison bison) abundance in Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada, declined from in excess of 10 000 bison in the late 1960s to a low of 2200 bison in the late 1990s. 2. Bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) and brucellosis (Brucella abortus), were introduced to Wood Buffalo National Park in the late 1920s. As each of these pathogens have the potential to reduce survival and reproduction in bison, they are suspected to have played a role in the decline in bison abundance. 3. We live-captured bison for disease testing in February and March of 1997, 1998 and 1999. Forty-nine percent tested positive for tuberculosis (i.e. were positive on the caudal fold test and/or fluorescent polarization assay, n = 342). Further, 30.9\% of bison were seropositive for brucellosis (i.e. agglutinated in the buffered-plate antigen test and had a titre of 1 : 5 in the complement fixation test or had a titre of greater than or equal to 1 : 10 in the complement fixation test, n = 346). Prevalence for both diseases increased with age and males were more likely to test positive for tuberculosis. Prevalence of either disease did not appear to be directly related to density of bison, as prevalence rates were not greater in the high density Delta population than the lower density Hay Camp and Nyarling River populations. 4. Comparison of our results to previous brucellosis and tuberculosis surveys in Wood Buffalo National Park indicates that prevalence of neither pathogen is a direct function of bison density. These pathogens are endemic within the bison population of the park.},

	Abstract = {Brucellosis occurs in free-ranging elk (Cervus elaphus) and bison (Bison bison) in the Greater Yellowstone Area, which includes portions of Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana. Brucella abortus was first detected in elk in Idaho in 1998, and from 1998 to 2002, serologic surveillance of hunter-killed elk was conducted in northeastern and southeastern Idaho. Prevalence of antibodies in these elk varied annually, but averaged between 2\% and 3\%. Elk were also trapped in northeastern Idaho from 1998-2002 and tested for brucellosis using serology and tissue culture. in areas where artificial feeding of elk was done, antibody prevalence ranged from 12\% to 80\% depending on site, age, and sex. At one feeding site (Rainey Creek), a decline in the prevalence of antibodies (from 56.8\% in 1999 to 13.5\% in 2002) was detected after the removal of seropositive elk over 4 yr. Seropositive elk removed from two artificial winter feeding sites (Rainey Creek and Conant Creek) were euthanized and sampled or held in captivity and allowed to calve prior to euthanasia and necropsy. At necropsy, B. abortus biovar 1 and B. abortus biovar 4 were isolated from both cows and calves; however, biovar 4 was predominant. A dual infection with both biovars was found in one calf born to a seropositive cow from which biovar 4 was isolated. Abortions (16\%), stillbirths (8\%), and weak calves (4\%) were observed in these elk. These findings confirm the presence of brucellosis in elk in eastern Idaho and provide information on disease management options.},

	Abstract = {Bison (Bison bison) and elk (Cervus elaphus) of the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) are the last remaining reservoirs of bovine brucellosis (Brucella abortus) in the United States. An important factor in evaluating the risk of transmission to cattle is the persistence of bacteria and infectious birth materials shed on pastures where cattle graze. We selected 2 study areas near the northern and western boundaries of Yellowstone National Park (YNP) to determine the persistence of bacteria on fetal tissue, soil, and vegetation, and scavenging on infectious materials from birth and abortion sites. We performed 3 independent field experiments to determine: 1) persistence of Brucella abortus (RB51) purposely applied to fetal tissues, 2) scavenging of fetuses by native scavengers, and 3) natural contamination of birth or abortion sites in the GYA. Results from these field experiments established that Brucella bacteria can persist on fetal tissues and soil or vegetation for 2181 days depending on month, temperature, and exposure to sunlight. Bacteria purposely applied to fetal tissues persisted longer in February than May and did not survive on tissues beyond 10 June regardless of when they were set out. Brucella abortus field strain persisted up to 43 days on soil and vegetation at naturally contaminated bison birth or abortion sites. Fetuses were scavenged by a variety of birds and mammals in areas near YNP and more rapidly inside YNP than outside the Park boundary. Models derived from our data determined a 0.05\% chance of bacterial survival beyond 26 days (95\% Credible Interval of 1830 days) for a contamination event in May. May 15 is the final date for hazing all bison into Yellowstone National Park under the current interagency bison management plan. With these data managers can predict when it is safe to graze cattle onto pastures previously occupied by bison. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

	Abstract = {Brucellosis is endemic in elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) using winter feedgrounds of western Wyoming, USA presumably because of increased animal density, duration of attendance, and subsequent contact with aborted fetuses. However, previous research addressed antibody prevalence rather than more direct measures of transmission and did not account for elk behavior or scavenging in transmission risk. Throughout March and early April 2005-07, we monitored 48 sets of pseudoaborted elk fetuses, placentas, and fluids (fetal units, FUs) on one winter free-ranging location and four sites (Feedline, High Traffic, Low Traffic, Adjacent) associated with four feedgrounds. "At-risk" elk (total elk within 5 in of FU) and proportions of elk sniffing and contacting FUs were highest on Feedlines and decreased toward Low Traffic sites. We did not observe elk investigating FUs Adjacent to feedgrounds or on the WFR location.. At-risk elk on Feedline and High Traffic sites decreased throughout the sampling period, whereas proportions of elk investigating FUs were correlated positively to at-risk elk among all sites within feedgrounds. At-risk elk and proportions of elk investigating F-Us were correlated with total feedground elk density and population only on High Traffic and Low Traffic sites. Proportions of sex/age groups (female, juvenile, male) investigating FUs did not differ from background populations. Females, however, spent more time (mean [SE], 21.07 [3.47] sec) investigating F-Us than juveniles (14.73 [3.53] sec) Mid males (10.12 [1.45] sec), with positive correlation between total investigations and time spent investigating per female. Eight species of scavengers consumed FUs, re removing FUs faster on feedgrounds than WFR locations and reducing proportions of elk that investigated F-Us. Our results suggest that 1.) reduction of elk density and time attending feedgrounds, particularly on Feedlines; and 2) protection of scavengers on and adjacent to feedgrounds would likely reduce intraspecific transmission risk of brucellosis.},

	Abstract = {Aims: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of environmental conditions and material type on persistence and inactivation of Brucella suis. Methods and Results: Brucella suis (approx. 1 x 108 CFU) was spiked onto surfaces (glass, aluminium and wood) by liquid inoculation. Persistence was evaluated over 56 days at 22 +/- 2 degrees C, 40 +/- 15\% r.h. and 5 +/- 3 degrees C, 30 +/- 15\% r.h. In addition, three readily available decontaminants (pH-adjusted bleach, 70\% ethanol and 1\% citric acid) were evaluated for their effectiveness at inactivating Br. suis on these materials. Decontaminations were conducted following 0 and 28 days exposure to the two conditions. Results indicated that Br. suis can persist on environmental surfaces for at least 56 days. Persistence was highest at low temperature. Decontamination was most challenging on wood with all three decontaminants. Conclusions: Following a Br. suis contamination incident, passive decontamination (through attenuation) may not be feasible, as this organism can persist for months. In addition, the results suggest that some sporicidal decontaminants may be ineffective on materials such as wood, even for vegetative biological agents such as Br. suis. Significance and Impact of Study: This study aids incident commanders and remediation experts to make informed decisions regarding decontamination after a biological contamination incident.},

	Abstract = {Interactions between wildlife and domestic livestock have created conflict for centuries because of pathogen transmission, competition for space and food, and predation. However, the transmission of pathogens from wildlife to domestic animals has recently gained prominence, including H5N1 avian influenza from wild ducks to poultry, bovine tuberculosis from badgers to cattle, and brucellosis from elk and bison to cattle. The risk of transmission of Brucella abortus (the causative agent of brucellosis) from bison (Bison bison) to cattle around Yellowstone National Park (YNP) is a hotly debated topic and an important conservation issue. Here we use a model to integrate epidemiological and ecological data to assess the spatio-temporal relative risk of transmission of Brucella from bison to cattle outside YNP under different scenarios. Our risk assessment shows that relative risk is spatially and temporally heterogeneous with local hotspots, shows a highly skewed distribution with predominantly low risk, and is strongly dependent on climate and the abundance of bison. We outline two strategies for managing this risk, and highlight the consequences of the current adaptive management plan. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide a detailed quantitative assessment of risk that offers several advantages over projections of numbers of bison leaving Yellowstone National Park. They suggest that risk could be effectively managed with lower costs, but that land use issues and the larger question of bison population management and movement outside the park might hinder the prospect of solutions that will please all stakeholders. More broadly, our work provides a model framework for quantifying the risk of wildlife-livestock pathogen transmission to guide management actions.},

Since none of the tests could be considered as a proper reference test and for about half of the tested sera the true status (sero-converted or not for non-structural proteins, i.e. presence of antibodies) of the animals was unknown, a Bayesian analysis employing a latent class model was used that did not rely on the use of a reference test or gold standard. Prior information about prevalence for subsets of the data and specificity of the tests was incorporated into the analysis. The specificity of the six tests for vaccinated and non-vaccinated cattle ranged from 96 to 99\%. For vaccinated cattle, one test stood out with an estimated sensitivity of 94\% (95\% CI from 89.8 to 98.1 \%). Second best for vaccinated cattle were two tests with estimated sensitivities of 85\% (95\% CI from 78.9 to 89.7\%) and 92\% (95\% CI from 86.2 to 95.6\%). For non-vaccinated cattle, the sensitivities of these three tests were around 97\%. The remaining three tests showed lowerestimated sensitivity for vaccinated cattle, ranging from 57 to 79\%.

	Abstract = {The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is a large wild bovid which until recently ranged across all but the driest parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and their local range being limited to about 20 km from surface water. They are of high ecological value due to their important role as bulk feeders in the grazing hierarchy. They also have high economic value, because they are one of the sought after 'Big Five' in the eco-tourism industry. In Africa, buffaloes have been recognised for some time as an important role player in the maintenance and transmission of a variety of economically important livestock diseases at the wildlife and/or livestock interface. These include African strains of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), Corridor disease (theileriosis), bovine tuberculosis and bovine brucellosis. For a number of other diseases of veterinary importance, African buffaloes may also serve as amplifier or incidental host, whereby infection with the causative pathogens may cause severe clinical signs such as death or abortion as in the case of anthrax and Rift Valley fever, or remain mild or subclinical for example heartwater. The long term health implications of most of those infections on the buffalo at a population level is usually limited, and they do not pose a threat on the population's survival. Because of their ability to harbour and transmit important diseases to livestock, their sustainable future in ecotourism, trade and transfrontier conservation projects become complex and costly and reliable diagnostic tools are required to monitor these infections in buffalo populations.},

	Abstract = {African animal trypanosomiasis is caused by a range of tsetse transmitted protozoan parasites including Trypanosoma vivax, Trypanosoma congolense and Trypansoma brucei. In Western Kenya and other parts of East Africa two subspecies of T. brucei, T.b. brucei and the zoonotic T.b. rhodesiense, co-circulate in livestock. A range of polymerase chain reactions (PCR) have been developed as important molecular diagnostic tools for epidemiological investigations of T. brucei s.l. in the animal reservoir and of its zoonotic potential. Quantification of the relative performance of different diagnostic PCRs is essential to ensure comparability of studies. This paper describes an evaluation of two diagnostic test systems for T. brucei using a T. brucei s.l. specific PCR [1] and a single nested PCR targeting the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) regions of trypanosome ribosomal DNA [2]. A Bayesian formulation of the Hui-Walter latent class model was employed to estimate their test performance in the absence of a gold standard test for detecting T. brucei s.l. infections in ear-vein blood samples from cattle, pig, sheep and goat populations in Western Kenya, stored on Whatman FTA cards. The results indicate that the system employing the T. brucei s.l. specific PCR (Se(1) = 0.760) had a higher sensitivity than the ITS-PCR (Se(2) = 0.640); both have high specificity (Sp(1) = 0.998; Sp(2) = 0.997). The true prevalences for livestock populations were estimated (p(cattle) = 0.091, p(pigs) = 0.066, p(goats) = 0.005, p(sheep) = 0.006), taking into account the uncertainties in the specificity and sensitivity of the two test systems. Implications of test performance include the required survey sample size; due to its higher sensitivity and specificity, the T. brucei s.l. specific PCR requires a consistently smaller sample size than the ITS-PCR for the detection of T. brucei s.l. However the ITS-PCR is able to simultaneously screen samples for other pathogenic trypanosomes and may thus be, overall, a better choice of test in multi-organism studies.},

In a comparative way, we consider the following 6 processes: (i) age-dependent exposure, (ii) parasite-induced host mortality, (iii) heterogeneity within the host population, (iv) clumped infection, (v) density-dependent parasite mortality and (vi) density-dependent parasite establishment. For each of these processes, we show typical patterns in the age-intensity profile and provide, if possible, explicit and simple solutions for the age-dependent mean parasite burden and the corresponding dispersion patterns. Emphasis is given to density-dependent parasite establishment and to age-intensity profiles resulting from the superposition of different processes. By means of 2 examples we show that the interpretation of observed patterns can be ambiguous if more than 1 process takes place. These findings underline that age-intensity profiles should be interpreted on the basis of available a priori knowledge about the processes assumed to be involved. For purposes of testing different hypotheses, a simulation program is provided with which discrepancies between model prediction and data can be explored.},

	Abstract = {Test-and-slaughter strategies have been the basis of bovine tuberculosis (BT) eradication programs worldwide; however, eradication efforts have not succeeded in certain regions, and imperfect sensitivity and specificity of applied diagnostic techniques have been deemed as one of the possible causes for such failure. Evaluation of tuberculosis diagnostic tools has been impaired by the lack of an adequate gold standard to define positive and negative individuals. Here, a Bayesian approach was formulated to estimate for the first time sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the tests [single intradermal tuberculin (SIT) test, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) assay] currently used in Spain. Field data from the first implementation of IFN-gamma assay (used in parallel with SIT test 2-6 months after a first disclosure SIT test) in infected beef, dairy and bullfighting cattle herds from the region of Castilla and Leon were used for the analysis. Model results suggested that in the described situation: (i) Se of SIT test was highly variable (40.1-92.2\% for severe interpretation, median = 66-69\%), and its Sp was high ({\textgreater}99\%) regardless interpretation criteria; (ii) IFN-gamma assay showed a high Se (median = 89-90\% and 83.5\% for 0.05 and 0.1 cut-off points respectively) and an acceptable Sp (85.7\% and 90.3\% for 0.05 and 0.1 thresholds) and (iii) parallel application of both tests maximized the combined Se (95.6\% using severe SIT and 0.05 cut-off point in the IFN-gamma assay). These results support the potential use of the IFN-gamma assay as an ancillary technique for routine BT diagnosis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The area under the curve is a useful overall measure of test accuracy and can be used to compare different tests (or different equipment) used by the same tester, as well as the accuracy of different diagnosticians that use the same test material. To date, ROC analysis has not been widely used in veterinary clinical pathology studies, although it should be considered a useful complement to estimates of sensitivity and specificity in test evaluation studies. In addition, calculation of likelihood ratios can potentially improve the clinical utility of such studies because likelihood ratios provide an indication of how the post-test probability changes as a function of the magnitude of the test results. For ordinal test results, likelihood ratios can be calculated on a category-specific basis from the empirical data or by using the slope of the line joining adjacent category limits on the ROC curve. For continuous test results, data need to be categorized into intervals for estimation of likelihood ratios, or they can be calculated as the slope (tangent) to the ROC curve at a unique test value. We use ROC analysis and calculate likelihood ratios to evaluate the performance of tests reported in 2 articles previously published in this journal.},

@article{gelman_posterior_1996,
	Abstract = {This paper considers Bayesian counterparts of the classical tests for goodness of fit and their use in judging the fit of a single Bayesian model to the observed data. We focus on posterior predictive assessment, in a framework that also includes conditioning on auxiliary statistics. The Bayesian formulation facilitates the construction and calculation of a meaningful reference distribution not only for any (classical) statistic, but also for any parameter-dependent ''statistic'' or discrepancy. The latter allows us to propose the realized discrepancy assessment of model fitness, which directly measures the true discrepancy between data and the posited model, for any aspect of the model which we want to explore. The computation required for the realized discrepancy assessment is a straightforward byproduct of the posterior simulation used for the original Bayesian analysis. We illustrate with three applied examples. The first example, which serves mainly to motivate the work, illustrates the difficulty of classical tests in assessing the fitness of a Poisson model to a positron emission tomography image that is constrained to be nonnegative. The second and third examples illustrate the details of the posterior predictive approach in two problems: estimation in a model with inequality constraints on the parameters, and estimation in a mixture model. In all three examples, standard test statistics (either a chi(2) or a likelihood ratio) are not pivotal: the difficulty is not just how to compute the reference distribution for the test, but that in the classical framework no such distribution exists, independent of the unknown model parameters.},

	Abstract = {We examined the relative importance of intrinsic host factors and microparasite co-infection in generating variation in Heligmosomoides polygyrus fecundity, a parameter that serves as a proxy for infectiousness. We undertook extensive trapping of Apodemus flavicollis, the yellow-necked mouse in the woodlands of the Italian Alps and recorded eggs in utero from the dominant nematode species H. polygyrus, and tested for the presence of five microparasite infections. The results showed that sex and breeding status interact, such that males in breeding condition harboured more fecund nematodes than other hosts; in particular, worms from breeding males had, on average, 52\% more eggs in utero than worms from non-breeding males. In contrast, we found a weak relationship between intensity and body mass, and no relationship between intensity and sex or intensity and breeding condition. We did not find any evidence to support the hypothesis that co-infection with microparasites contributed to variation in worm fecundity in this system. The age-intensity profiles for mice singly-infected with H. polygyrus and those co-infected with the nematode and at least one microparasite were both convex and not statistically different from each other. We concluded that intrinsic differences between hosts, specifically with regard to sex and breeding condition, contribute relatively more to the variation in worm fecundity than parasite co-infection status.},

@article{godfroid_diagnosis_2010,
	Abstract = {Aim To describe and discuss the merits of various direct and indirect methods applied in vitro (mainly on blood or milk) or in vivo (allergic test) for the diagnosis of brucellosis in animals. Methods The recent literature on brucellosis diagnostic tests was reviewed. These diagnostic tests are applied with different goals, such as national screening, confirmatory diagnosis, certification, and international trade. The validation of such diagnostic tests is still an issue, particularly in wildlife. The choice of the testing strategy depends on the prevailing brucellosis epidemiological situation and the goal of testing. Results Measuring the kinetics of antibody production after Brucella spp. infection is essential for analyzing serological results correctly and may help to predict abortion. Indirect ELISAs help to discriminate 1) between false positive serological reactions and true brucellosis and 2) between vaccination and infection. Biotyping of Brucella spp. provides valuable epidemiological information that allows tracing an infection back to the sources in instances where several biotypes of a given Brucella species are circulating. Polymerase chain reaction and new molecular methods are likely to be used as routine typing and fingerprinting methods in the coming years. Conclusion The diagnosis of brucellosis in livestock and wildlife is complex and serological results need to be carefully analyzed. The B. abortus S19 and B. melitensis Rev. 1 vaccines are the cornerstones of control programs in cattle and small ruminants, respectively. There is no vaccine available for pigs or for wildlife. In the absence of a human brucellosis vaccine, prevention of human brucellosis depends on the control of the disease in animals.},

Studies in insects, fish, amphibians and rodents show that infection occurrence and intensity are more probable and more severe in individuals with an underlying poor condition.

@article{eberhardt_parasitism_2013,
	Abstract = {Parasites play a key role in regulating wildlife population dynamics, but their impact on the host appears to be context-dependent. Evidence indicates that a synergistic interaction between stress, host condition and parasites is implicated in this phenomenon, but more studies are needed to better understand this context-dependency. With the goal to assess the net effect of two types of chronic stress on various host-parasite interactions, we conducted an experiment in capybaras to evaluate the impact of food restriction and physical restraint on the infection intensity of specific gastrointestinal nematodes and coccidia, and how these stressors affected the growth, body condition, and some immuno-physiological parameters. Our hypothesis was that both forms of stress would result in an alteration in the host-parasite interactions, with deteriorated condition and reduced immunological investment leading to high parasite burdens and vice versa. Stressed capybaras had significantly higher coccidia infection intensities; but among individuals that were smaller, those stressed consistently showed lower helminth burdens than controls. Both stress treatments had a marked negative impact on growth and body condition, but concomitantly they had a significant positive effect on some components of the immune system. Our results suggest, on the one hand, that during prolonged periods of stress capybaras preventatively invest in some components of their immunity, such as innate humoural defenses and cells that combat helminths, which could be considered a stress-dependent prophylaxis. On the other hand, stress was found to cause greater infection intensities of protozoans but lower burdens of nematodes, indicating that the relationship between stress, physiological trade-offs and infection depends on the type of parasite in question. Moreover, both findings might be related in a causal way, as one of the immunological parameters enhanced in stressed capybaras is associated with the immune response to control helminths.},

	Abstract = {Following infection with Ostertagia circumcincta there was considerable variation in worm burdens, worm size and number of inhibited larvae even among sheep matched for age, sex, breed, farm of origin and history of parasite exposure. There was also substantial variation among sheep in the concentration of mast cells, globule leucocytes, eosinophils, IgA-positive plasma cells and parasite-specific IgA in the abomasal mucosa. With the exception of faecal egg counts over time, the parasitological and immunological traits were all continually distributed among animals and sheep did not fall into discrete high and low-responder categories. The responses were correlated. Sheep with more mast cells also had more globule leucocytes, more eosinophils, more IgA plasma cells and greater amounts of parasite-specific IgA in the abomasal mucosa. Female worm length was strongly and positively correlated with the number of eggs in utero. Faecal egg counts were associated with variation in worm number and with variation in the number of eggs in utero. The worm burden was negatively correlated with the number of globule leucocytes in the abomasal mucosa, suggesting that worm numbers ave regulated by immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Decreased female worm length was associated with an increased local IgA response to fourth stage larvae. The number of inhibited larvae was positively associated with the size of the local IgA response and positively associated with the size of the worm burden. The results suggest that variation among mature sheep in faecal egg counts is due, at least in part, to variation in local IgA responses which regulate worm fecundity and to variation in local immediate hypersensitivity reactions which regulate worm burdens.},

@article{zhang_interactive_2012,
	Abstract = {Host resistance and parasite virulence are influenced by multiple interacting factors in complex natural communities. Yet, these interactive effects are seldom studied concurrently, resulting in poor understanding of host-pathogen-environment dynamics. Here, we investigated how the level of opportunist pathogen virulence, strength of host immunity and the host condition manipulated via diet affect the survival of wood tiger moth Parasemia plantaginis (Arctidae). Larvae from "low cuticular melanin" and "high cuticular melanin" (considered as low and high pathogen resistance, respectively) selection lines were infected with moderately and highly virulent bacteria strains of Serratia marcescens, while simultaneously manipulating host diet (with or without antibacterial compounds). We measured host survival and food preference before and after infection to test whether the larvae "self-medicate" by choosing an anti-infection diet (Plantago major, i.e., plantain leaf) over lettuce (Lactuca sativa). "High melanin" larvae were more resistant than "low melanin" larvae to the less virulent strain that had slower growth and colonization rate compared with the more virulent strain. Cuticular melanin did not enhance survival when the larvae were infected with the highly virulent strain. Anti-infection diet enhanced survival of the "high melanin" but not the "low melanin" hosts. Survival was dependent on family origin even within the melanin selection lines. Despite the intrinsic preference for lettuce, no evidence of self-medication was found. These results demonstrate that the relative benefit of host cuticular melanin depends on both diet and pathogen virulence: plantain diet only boosted the immunity of already resistant "high melanin" hosts, and cuticular melanin increased host survival only when infected with moderately virulent pathogen. Moreover, there was considerable variation in host survival between families within both melanin lines suggesting genetic basis for resistance. These results indicate that although melanin is an important predictor of insect immunity, its effect on disease outcomes greatly depends on other interacting factors.},

	Abstract = {The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is a large wild bovid which until recently ranged across all but the driest parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and their local range being limited to about 20 km from surface water. They are of high ecological value due to their important role as bulk feeders in the grazing hierarchy. They also have high economic value, because they are one of the sought after 'Big Five' in the eco-tourism industry. In Africa, buffaloes have been recognised for some time as an important role player in the maintenance and transmission of a variety of economically important livestock diseases at the wildlife and/or livestock interface. These include African strains of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), Corridor disease (theileriosis), bovine tuberculosis and bovine brucellosis. For a number of other diseases of veterinary importance, African buffaloes may also serve as amplifier or incidental host, whereby infection with the causative pathogens may cause severe clinical signs such as death or abortion as in the case of anthrax and Rift Valley fever, or remain mild or subclinical for example heartwater. The long term health implications of most of those infections on the buffalo at a population level is usually limited, and they do not pose a threat on the population's survival. Because of their ability to harbour and transmit important diseases to livestock, their sustainable future in ecotourism, trade and transfrontier conservation projects become complex and costly and reliable diagnostic tools are required to monitor these infections in buffalo populations.},

@article{greiner_meta-analytical_2009,
	Abstract = {In the assessment of diagnostic tests the task may arise to show that a candidate test is non-inferior compared to a comparative (standard) test with regard to the diagnostic sensitivity or specificity. This setting is known as "one-sided equivalence" and has been applied to a single comparison between two diagnostic tests (Chen et al., 2003). Recently, the approach has been extended into a meta-analytical framework (EFSA, 2006), allowing for the difference between the sensitivity (or specificity) of two diagnostic tests to be estimated using information gathered through systematic literature review. Using this approach, confounding factors are adjusted by matching of parameter estimates on study population and preferred levels of the confounding factors. However, the power of this approach was found to be limited and therefore Markov chain Monte Carlo logistic regression (MCMCLR) models that allow adjustment for confounding variables have been developed (EFSA, 2006). We report here a refinement of the statistical inference based on the latter approach. The objective was to generate a posterior distribution of the meta-analytical difference statistic for the candidate test and a set of comparative tests. The algorithm for this purpose uses Monte Carlo sampling from the posterior distributions of sensitivity (or specificity) and, for each iteration, (i) identifies the least performant comparative test, (ii) establishes the difference statistics for this test and the candidate test and (iii) compares the difference statistic with a critical threshold value. The proportion of iterations in which the critical threshold was exceeded is then interpreted as the P-value for the one-sided equivalence test for the candidate versus the set of comparative tests. We illustrate and discuss the method using a case study on tests for bovine brucellosis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The latent class model allowed estimation of Se and Sp in the absence of a gold standard test. The c-ELISA had the highest Se (99.0\%; 95\% credible posterior interval (CPI): 94.8; 100\%), while the RBT and sFPA had the highest Sp (99.0\%; 95\% CPI: 98.0; 99.6\%). The bFPA had the lowest Se (71.3\%; 95\% CPI: 56.2, 83.5\%), while its Sp (96.3\%; CPI: 93.9; 98.0\%) was marginally higher than that of the c-ELISA (95.4\% CPI: 93.7; 96.8\%). Therefore based on these data, test regimen using the RBT and c-ELISA could be suitable for diagnosis of brucellosis in smallholder dairies in Zimbabwe. Based on cost and ease of performance, the sFPA may be adopted as a confirmatory test, but its performance may be optimised by altering cut-off points to suit the Zimbabwean conditions. Thus, latent class models provide an alternative method for evaluating Se and Sp of diagnostic tests, which could be used to optimise test performance in different cattle populations.

@article{meng_posterior_1994,
	Abstract = {Extending work of Rubin, this paper explores a Bayesian counterpart of the classical p-value, namely, a tail-area probability of a ''test statistic'' under a null hypothesis. The Bayesian formulation, using posterior predictive replications of the data, allows a ''test statistic'' to depend on both data and unknown (nuisance) parameters and thus permits a direct measure of the discrepancy between sample and population quantities. The tail-area probability for a ''test statistic'' is then found under the joint posterior distribution of replicate data and the (nuisance) parameters, both conditional on the null hypothesis. This posterior predictive p-value can also be viewed as the posterior mean of a classical p-value, averaging over the posterior distribution of(nuisance) parameters under the null hypothesis, and thus it provides one general method for dealing with nuisance parameters. Two classical examples, including the Behrens-Fisher problem, are used to illustrate the posterior predictive p-value and some of its interesting properties, which also reveal a new (Bayesian) interpretation for some classical p-values. An application to multiple-imputation inference is also presented. A frequency evaluation shows that, in general, if the replication is defined by new (nuisance) parameters and new data, then the Type I frequentist error of an alpha-level posterior predictive test is often close to but less than alpha and will never exceed 2 alpha.},

	Abstract = {In the assessment of the accuracy of diagnostic tests for infectious diseases, the true disease status of the subjects is often unknown due to the lack of a gold standard test. Latent class models with two latent classes, representing diseased and non-diseased subjects, are often used to analyze this type of data. In its basic format, latent class analysis requires the observed outcomes to be statistically independent conditional on the disease status. In most diagnostic settings, this assumption is highly questionable. During the last decade, several methods have been proposed to estimate latent class models with conditional dependence between the test results. A class of flexible fixed and random effects models were described by Dendukuri and Joseph in a Bayesian framework. We illustrate these models using the analysis of a diagnostic study of three field tests and an imperfect reference test for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis. We show that, as observed earlier by Albert and Dodd, different dependence models may result in similar fits to the data while resulting in different inferences. Given this problem, selection of appropriate latent class models should be based on substantive subject matter knowledge. If several clinically plausible models are supported by the data, a sensitivity analysis should be performed by describing the results obtained from different models and using different priors.

Both frequentistic and Bayesian statistical inference were used. A frequentistic analysis, using sera from known gold standard (GS) populations (i.e., from truly infected or brucellosis free animals), resulted in maximum (100\%) diagnostic sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) in the RBT, i-ELISA and b-ELISA tests. However, c-ELISAs resulted in lower diagnostic Se (ranging from 68.5\% to 92.6\%, according to the different cut-offs selected). A Bayesian analysis of tests yielding the best diagnostic performance with GS sera (RBT, i-ELISA and b-ELISA), but using a large collection of field sera, resulted in similar Se among tests but markedly lower (approximate to 180\%) than that resulting from the frequentistic analysis using the GS serum populations. By contrast, the estimated Sp in the Bayesian analysis was only slightly lower than 100\%, thus similar to that obtained frequentistically. Our results show that adequate diagnostic tests for brucellosis in swine are available, but also emphasize the need for more extensive validation studies before applying these tests under field conditions.

	Abstract = {Serological diagnosis of brucellosis began more than 100 years ago with a simple agglutination test. It was realized that this type of test was susceptible to false positive reactions resulting from, for instance, exposure to cross reacting microorganisms. It was also realized that this test format was inexpensive, simple and could be rapid, although results were subjectively scored. Therefore, a number of modifications were developed along with other types of tests. This served two purposes: one was to establish a rapid screening test with high sensitivity and perhaps legs specificity and a confirmatory test, usually more complicated but also more specific, to be used on sera that reacted positively in screening tests. This led to another problem: if a panel of tests were performed and they did not all agree, which interpretation was correct? This problem was further compounded by the extensive use of a vaccine which gave rise to an antibody response similar to that resulting from field infection. This led to the development of an assay that could distinguish vaccinal antibody, starting with precipitin tests. These tests did not perform well, giving rise to the development of primary binding assays. These assays, including the competitive enzyme immunoassay and the fluorescence polarization assay are at the apex of current development, providing high sensitivity and specificity as well as speed and mobility in the case of the fluorescence polarization assay.

	Abstract = {Diagnostic screening involves testing humans or animals for the presence of disease or infection. For some diseases, a perfect, "gold-standard" test does not exist or is too invasive or expensive to use. Hence, the goals of diagnostic testing may include: quantifying the performance of an imperfect test, diagnosing subjects, and estimating disease prevalence - possibly in the absence of a perfect reference test. To date, most work in this area has focused on cross-sectional data. We extend recent work by developing a model for bivariate longitudinal diagnostic outcomes in the no-gold standard case. We consider the situation where a continuous test and a binary test are repeatedly administered to each subject. For infected subjects, we assume the existence of a changepoint corresponding to time of infection and posit appropriate changes to the model thereafter. This results in a varying-dimensional parameter space since the true infection status of the subjects is unknown. We make inference using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, incorporating the Reversible Jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm of Green for posterior simulation from a varying-dimensional parameter space. We test the model's performance on simulated data, and then analyze a data set based on Johne's disease in cattle.},

	Abstract = {The true prevalence of brucellosis and diagnostic test characteristics of three conditionally dependent serological tests were estimated using the Bayesian approach in goats and sheep populations of Bangladesh. Serum samples from a random selection of 636 goats and 1044 sheep were tested in parallel by indirect ELISA (iELISA), Rose Bengal Test (RBT) and Slow Agglutination Test (SAT). The true prevalence of brucellosis in goats and sheep were estimated as 1\% (95\% credibility interval (CrI): 0.7-1.8) and 1.2\% (95\% CrI: 0.6-2.2) respectively. The sensitivity of iELISA was 92.9\% in goats and 92.0\% in sheep with corresponding specificities of 96.5\% and 99.5\% respectively. The sensitivity and specificity estimates of RBT were 80.2\% and 99.6\% in goats and 82.8\% and 98.3\% in sheep. The sensitivity and specificity of SAT were 57.1\% and 99.3\% in goats and 72.0\% and 98.6\% in sheep. In this study, three conditionally dependent serological tests for the diagnosis of small ruminant brucellosis in Bangladesh were validated. Considerable conditional dependence between IELISA and RBT and between RBT and SAT was observed among sheep. The influence of the priors on the model fit and estimated parameter values was checked using sensitivity analysis. In multiple test validation, conditional dependence should not be ignored when the tests are in fact conditionally dependent. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Several areas traditionally considered to be endemic-eg, France, Israel, and most of Latin America-have achieved control of the disease. On the other hand, new foci of human brucellosis have emerged, particularly in central Asia, while the situation in certain countries of the near east (eg, Syria) is rapidly worsening. Furthermore, the disease is still present, in varying trends, both in European countries and in the USA.

	Abstract = {Giardia duodenalis is considered a potentially zoonotic protozoan. Some animal species, including infected dogs, may play an important role in the spread of Giardia cysts through environmental contamination with their feces. In the present study, a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to examine 143 samples of dog feces collected in urban areas as an indicator of the risk of field contamination. Using a Bayesian statistical approach, the ELISA showed a sensitivity of 88.9\% and a specificity of 95.8\% with positive and negative predictive values of 89.6\% and 95.4\%, respectively. The test affords the advantage of rapid processing of fecal samples without a complex technical structure and extensive costly labor. Moreover, the present results show that the assay provides public health veterinarians with a practical tool that can be used in screening programs, as a valid alternative or as an adjunct to other tests, in order to assess the biological risk of exposure to G. duodenalis cysts from dogs in human settlements. However, the test may not be completely accurate for human health risk evaluation, as it does not discriminate between zoonotic and non-zoonotic isolates.},

	Abstract = {Nematode infections are subject to density-dependent effects on their establishment, survivorship and fecundity within a host. These effects act to regulate and stabilize the size of nematode populations. Understanding how these density-dependent effects occur is important to guide the development of control strategies against parasitic nematodes and the diseases that they cause. These density-dependent effects have been hypothesized to result from intraspecific competition between parasites for limited resources or from the action of host immune responses. However, no specific evidence exists to distinguish between these two hypotheses. We find that in nematode (Strongyloides ratti) infections, density-dependent effects on parasite establishment, survivorship and fecundity are mediated by the host immune response. These density-dependent effects are only observed late in primary infections and no density-depenclent effects are observed in infections in immuno-compromised animals. We find no evidence for intraspecific competition between parasites in experimental infections over a range of doses that encompasses all that is observed in natural infections. We conclude that density-dependent effects due to the immune response will act to regulate S. ratti infections before competition for space or nutrients within the host gut ever occurs.},

In such a situation, the estimation of prevalence is difficult if none of the tests is considered to be a gold standard. In this paper we develop a Bayesian approach to estimating disease prevalence based on the results of two diagnostic tests, allowing for the possibility that the tests are conditionally dependent, but not conditioning on any particular dependence structure. This involves the construction of four models with various forms of conditional dependence and uses Bayesian model averaging, enabled by reversible jump MCMC, to obtain an overall estimate of the prevalence.

They discuss a recent article in which a Bayesian approach to this problem is developed based on data that are sampled from a single population. It was subsequently pointed out that such inferences will not necessarily be accurate in the sense that standard errors for parameters may not decrease as n increases. This problem will generally occur when the data are insufficient to estimate all of the parameters as is the case when screening a single population with two tests. If both tests are applied to units sampled from two populations, however, this particular difficulty disappears.

	Abstract = {Latent class models were used to estimate the sensitivity (Se) and the specificity (Sp) of a serum ELISA and a faecal culture (FC) method for the diagnosis of paratuberculosis separately, in sheep and goats. The estimates were obtained by a Bayesian method. Possible dependence of diagnostic errors was investigated by comparing models where independence was assumed to models allowing for conditional dependence given the true disease status. ROC analysis for the serum ELISA was also performed and optimized cut-off values based on the misclassification cost term were determined. No evidence of conditional dependence was found. Assuming independence, posterior medians and 95\% credible intervals for the Se-ELISA, SPELISA, Se-FC and SPFC, were 63\% (42, 93\%), 95\% (90, 98\%), 8\% (2,17\%) and 98\% (95, 100\%) in goats and 37\% (10, 80\%),97\% (93,99\%),16\% (2,48\%) and 97\% (95, 99\%) in sheep. AUC was calculated 0.702 for sheep and 0.847 for goats. For the serum ELISA, there is need of species- and purpose-specific cut-off selection. For instance, with 20\% prevalence situation and assuming equal and five-fold cost of a false negative to a false positive test result, the optimal cut-off is 0.3 and 0.05 in sheep, respectively, while it is 0.6 and 0.1 in goats, respectively. Serum ELISA performed better in goats than in sheep. Lowering the cut-off, in relation to the one recommended by the manufacturer, improved Se-ELISA without seriously compromising SPELISA, in either species. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {We determined the individual and population responses to food availability of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus wintering in small forest woodlots by means of a food addition experiment. The allocation of the extra provided energy to the maintenance of body condition and reproduction was expected to vary between sexes due to their different energy investment in reproduction and to the different indirect costs of reproduction associated with different hormone-mediated susceptibilities to parasite infections. There were no effects of food supplementation on the density of adult males or on the overall density of mice. However, adult females were marginally more abundant and the sex ratio was more balanced in supplemented woodlots. Body condition (as estimated by body mass, body mass relative to body size, and amount of fat reserves), did not differ among treatments for either adult males or females. The prevalence and intensity of endoparasites of short life cycle (oxyurid nematodes) were lower in food-supplemented woodlots than in controls and lower in females than in males. No differences were found for endoparasites with long life cycles (telacid nematodes and cestodes). Males with intermediate parasite loads were in better body condition than either nonparasitized or highly parasitized individuals, and the body condition of each group of males was better in food-supplemented woodlots than in controls. This nonlinear relationship between parasite loads and body condition was apparently due to indirect costs of reproduction in control woodlots, where there was a direct relationship between male reproductive effort (relative testis size) and parasite loads. This relationship was not found in supplemented woodlots. Most individuals were breeding actively at the end of winter. Males had larger testicles, and females showed an advanced breeding, and probably enhanced survival and larger litter sizes, in supplemented woodlots. Individual mice wintering in Mediterranean fragmented forests are thus food limited, and directed most of the extra provided food resources to reproduction without losing body condition or antiparasite abilities. This enhanced reproduction, rather than improved body condition, may translate into larger population densities and recruitment.},

	Abstract = {Population genetic structure is often used to infer population connectivity, but genetic structure may largely reflect historical rather than recent processes. We contrasted genetic structure with recent gene-flow estimates among 6 herds of African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in the Caprivi Strip, Namibia, using 134 individuals genotyped at 10 microsatellite loci. We tested whether historical and recent gene flows were influenced by distance, potential barriers (rivers), or landscape resistance (distance from water). We also tested at what scales individuals were more related than expected by chance. Genetic structure across the Caprivi Strip was weak, indicating that historically, gene flow was strong and was not affected by distance, barriers, or landscape resistance. Our analysis of simulated data suggested that genetic structure would be unlikely to reflect human disturbances in the last 1020 generations (75150 years) because of slow predicted rates of genetic drift, but recent gene-flow estimates would be affected. Recent gene-flow estimates were not consistently affected by rivers or distance to water but showed that isolation by distance appears to be developing. Average relatedness estimates among individuals exceeded random expectations only within herds. We conclude that historically, African buffalo moved freely throughout the Caprivi Strip, whereas recent gene flow has been more restricted. Our findings support efforts to maintain the connectivity of buffalo herds across this region and demonstrate the utility of contrasting genetic inferences from different time scales.},

	Abstract = {Mammalian immunology has been studied in great detail in laboratory animals, but few of the tools and less of the insight derived from these studies have been placed in the context of natural, outbred wildlife populations subject to variable environments. We investigated patterns of innate immunity in free-ranging African buffalo in relation to host traits (age, reproductive status, body condition, white blood cell counts) and disease status (bovine tuberculosis [BTB], gastrointestinal nematodes, coccidia, ticks). We evaluated and used an in vitro assay measuring bactericidal competence of blood to assess a component of innate immunity in 200 female buffalo captured at Kruger National Park, South Africa, in June/July and October 2008. Animals with BTB had higher bactericidal competence of blood. Animals with higher neutrophil counts had higher bactericidal competence, whereas animals with lower lymphocyte counts had higher bactericidal competence. This pattern was driven by animals captured at the end of the dry season (October) and may be evidence of immune polarization, whereby individuals are unable to upregulate multiple components of immunity simultaneously. Bactericidal competence did not vary with host pregnancy status, body condition, age, lactation, tick infestation, nematode egg count, or coccidia oocyst count. Overall, we demonstrate that the bactericidal competence assay is practical and informative for field-based studies in wild bovids. Our results also show a correlation between bactericidal competence and bovine tuberculosis infection and reveal possible functional polarizations between different types of immune response in a free-ranging mammal.},

For the sensitivity trial, cattle from herds being de-populated because of bovine tuberculosis were examined with both assays. The sensitivity of the IFN-gamma assay was shown to be significantly higher than the single intradermal tuberculin test and varied from 76.8\% to 93.6\% depending on the method of interpretation. A maximum overall sensitivity of 95.2\% was obtained by testing with the IFN-gamma and the tuberculin test in parallel. The superior sensitivity of the IFN-gamma assay and the ability to adjust the sensitivity of the system depending on the task involved, will provide the Australian Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign with a valuable additional test to enable it to accomplish its goals.},

	Abstract = {The application of diagnostic tests for bovine tuberculosis in wildlife poses formidable technical difficulties and the use of the gamma interferon assay offers a simplified approach to testing wild animal species. We compared the performance of the gamma interferon assay in African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) under the recommended guidelines for interpretation of test results and found a high sensitivity (92.1\%) at the cost of a greatly reduced specificity (68.3\%). The optimised cut-off value for positive test results under local conditions was identified at an optical density of 0.385 at wavelength 450 nm as the preferred compromise between sensitivity and specificity. Additional optimisation approaches to improve test performance were examined and showed that the application of 'a priori exclusions' of test results on the basis of reactivity to fortuitum PPD (sensitin produced from Mycobacterium fortuitum) and to a lesser degree, avian PPD, increased specificity without losing sensitivity. The implications of these findings on a modified testing protocol adjusted to include measurement of immune responsiveness to fortuitum PPD and other interpretation schemes are discussed.

Over the past decade, there has been a substantial increase in interest in the immune system and the role it plays in the regulation of disease susceptibility, giving rise to the field of eco-immunology. 2. Eco-immunology aims to understand changes in host immune responses in the broader framework of an organism's evolutionary, ecological and life-history contexts. 3. The immune system, however, is complex and multifaceted and can be intimidating for the nonimmunologist interested in incorporating immunological questions into their research. Which immune responses should one measure and what is the biological significance of these measures? 4. The focus of this review is to describe a wide range of eco-immunology techniques, from the simple to the sophisticated, with the goal of providing researchers with a range of options to consider incorporating in their own research programs. 5. These techniques were chosen because they provide relatively straightforward, biologically meaningful assessments of immune function, many of which can be performed across a range of ecological contexts (i.e. field vs. laboratory) and in a wide range of vertebrate animals without relying on species-specific reagents. 6. By incorporating assessments of immune function into their specific research questions, animal ecologists will gain a more comprehensive understanding of organism-environment interactions.},

	Abstract = {Alamar Blue in the microenvironment of activated cells, undergoes color change and also becomes fluorescent. By using the Alamar Blue dye, we have reported a non-radioactive colorimetric assay to indirectly determine proliferation of murine lymphocytes. We further show that the pattern of mitogen-induced proliferation assessed fluorometrically was comparable to the H-3-thymidine incorporation assay (H-3-Tdr assay). Of practical importance is that the color/fluorescence changes were stable at 4 degrees C in the dark for 3-4 weeks. In immunological studies, it is important to further analyze lymphocytes that have undergone activation and/or proliferation. This is not possible with the standard H-3-Tdr assay, which requires lysis of cells. In contrast, the Alamar Blue-based non-radioactive assay dues not require cell lysis. We therefore tested the hypothesis that further analysis of lymphocytes is possible, after assessing the proliferation using Alamar Blue. Following assessment of proliferation in a 72-h culture, the Alamar Blue dye was washed-off and cells were re-utilized to perform additional immunological analysis. Short-term exposure of lymphocytes to Alamar Blue was nor detrimental to lymphocytes, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion and the propidium iodide (PI) assays. Exposure of dexamethasone-treated cells to Alamar Blue did not interfere with the performance of apoptosis assays, such as flow cytometric analysis of PI-stained cells and microscopic examination of ethidium bromide/acridine orange-stained cells. In addition, prior exposure of lymphocytes to Alamar Blue did not affect the analysis of chromosomal aberrations or the visualization of cell surface antigens by flow cytometry. Further, the expression of cytokine mRNA in lymphocytes previously exposed to Alamar Blue was similar to unexposed cells. Together, a notable advantage of this assay is that it now enables the investigator to maximize information by following or correlating proliferation with other immunologic events in the same cells.

	Abstract = {In wild birds, relatively little is known about intra- or interspecific variation in immunological capabilities, and even less is known about the effects of stress on immune function. Immunological assays adaptable to field settings and suitable for a wide variety of taxa will prove most useful for addressing these issues. We describe a novel application of an in vitro technique that measures the intrinsic bacteria-killing abilities of blood. We assessed the capacities of whole blood and plasma from free-living individuals of five tropical bird species to kill a nonpathogenic strain of E. coli before and after the birds experienced an acute stress. Killing invasive bacteria is a fundamental immune function, and the bacteria-killing assay measures constitutive, innate immunity integrated across circulating cell and protein components. Killing ability varied significantly across species, with common ground doves exhibiting the lowest levels and blue-crowned motmots exhibiting the highest levels. Across species, plasma killed bacteria as effectively as whole blood, and higher concentrations of plasma killed significantly better. One hour of acute stress reduced killing ability by up to 40\%. This assay is expected to be useful in evolutionary and ecological studies dealing with physiological and immunological differences in birds.},

By using the Alamar Blue dye, we have reported a non-radioactive colorimetric assay to indirectly determine proliferation of murine lymphocytes. We further show that the pattern of mitogen-induced proliferation assessed fluorometrically was comparable to the H-3-thymidine incorporation assay (H-3-Tdr assay). Of practical importance is that the color/fluorescence changes were stable at 4 degrees C in the dark for 3-4 weeks. In immunological studies, it is important to further analyze lymphocytes that have undergone activation and/or proliferation. This is not possible with the standard H-3-Tdr assay, which requires lysis of cells. In contrast, the Alamar Blue-based non-radioactive assay dues not require cell lysis. We therefore tested the hypothesis that further analysis of lymphocytes is possible, after assessing the proliferation using Alamar Blue. Following assessment of proliferation in a 72-h culture, the Alamar Blue dye was washed-off and cells were re-utilized to perform additional immunological analysis. Short-term exposure of lymphocytes to Alamar Blue was nor detrimental to lymphocytes, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion and the propidium iodide (PI) assays. Exposure of dexamethasone-treated cells to Alamar Blue did not interfere with the performance of apoptosis assays, such as flow cytometric analysis of PI-stained cells and microscopic examination of ethidium bromide/acridine orange-stained cells. In addition, prior exposure of lymphocytes to Alamar Blue did not affect the analysis of chromosomal aberrations or the visualization of cell surface antigens by flow cytometry. Further, the expression of cytokine mRNA in lymphocytes previously exposed to Alamar Blue was similar to unexposed cells. Together, a notable advantage of this assay is that it now enables the investigator to maximize information by following or correlating proliferation with other immunologic events in the same cells.

	Abstract = {Mammalian immunology has been studied in great detail in laboratory animals, but few of the tools and less of the insight derived from these studies have been placed in the context of natural, outbred wildlife populations subject to variable environments. We investigated patterns of innate immunity in free-ranging African buffalo in relation to host traits (age, reproductive status, body condition, white blood cell counts) and disease status (bovine tuberculosis [BTB], gastrointestinal nematodes, coccidia, ticks). We evaluated and used an in vitro assay measuring bactericidal competence of blood to assess a component of innate immunity in 200 female buffalo captured at Kruger National Park, South Africa, in June/July and October 2008. Animals with BTB had higher bactericidal competence of blood. Animals with higher neutrophil counts had higher bactericidal competence, whereas animals with lower lymphocyte counts had higher bactericidal competence. This pattern was driven by animals captured at the end of the dry season (October) and may be evidence of immune polarization, whereby individuals are unable to upregulate multiple components of immunity simultaneously. Bactericidal competence did not vary with host pregnancy status, body condition, age, lactation, tick infestation, nematode egg count, or coccidia oocyst count. Overall, we demonstrate that the bactericidal competence assay is practical and informative for field-based studies in wild bovids. Our results also show a correlation between bactericidal competence and bovine tuberculosis infection and reveal possible functional polarizations between different types of immune response in a free-ranging mammal.},

@article{treanor_vaccination_2010,
	Abstract = {Concerns over migratory bison (Bison bison) at Yellowstone National Park transmitting brucellosis (Brucella abortus) to cattle herds on adjacent lands led to proposals for bison vaccination. We developed an individual-based model to evaluate how brucellosis infection might respond under alternate vaccination strategies, including: (1) vaccination of female calves and yearlings captured at the park boundary when bison move outside the primary conservation area; (2) combining boundary vaccination with the remote delivery of vaccine to female calves and yearlings distributed throughout the park; and (3) vaccinating all female bison (including adults) during boundary capture and throughout the park using remote delivery of vaccine. Simulations suggested Alternative 3 would be most effective, with brucellosis seroprevalence decreasing by 66\% (from 0.47 to 0.16) over a 30-year period resulting from 29\% of the population receiving protection through vaccination. Under this alternative, bison would receive multiple vaccinations that extend the duration of vaccine protection and defend against recurring infection in latently infected animals. The initial decrease in population seroprevalence will likely be slow due to high initial seroprevalence (40-60\%), long-lived antibodies, and the culling of some vaccinated bison that were subsequently exposed to field strain Brucella and reacted positively on serologic tests. Vaccination is unlikely to eradicate B. abort-us from Yellowstone bison, but could be an effective tool for reducing the level of infection. Our approach and findings have applicability world-wide for managers dealing with intractable wildlife diseases that cross wildlife-livestock and wildlife-human interfaces and affect public health or economic well-being.

@article{ebinger_simulating_2011,
	Abstract = {Brucella abortus, the causative agent of bovine brucellosis, infects wildlife, cattle, and humans worldwide, but management of the disease is often hindered by the logistics of controlling its prevalence in wildlife reservoirs. We used an individually based epidemiological model to assess the relative efficacies of three management interventions (sterilization, vaccination, and test-and-remove). The model was parameterized with demographic and epidemiological data from bison in Yellowstone National Park, USA. Sterilization and test-and-remove were most successful at reducing seroprevalence when they were targeted at young seropositive animals, which are the most likely age and sex category to be infectious. However, these approaches also required the most effort to implement. Vaccination was less effective (even with a perfect vaccine) but also required less effort to implement. For the treatment efforts we explored (50-100 individuals per year or 2.5-5\% of the female population), sterilization had little impact upon the bison population growth rate when selectively applied. The population growth rate usually increased by year 25 due to the reduced number of Brucella-induced abortions. Initial declines in seroprevalence followed by rapid increases ({\textgreater}= 15\% increase in 5 years) occurred in 3-13\% of simulations with sterilization and test-and-remove, but not vaccination. We believe this is due to the interaction of superspreading events and the loss of herd immunity in the later stages of control efforts as disease prevalence declines. Sterilization provided a mechanism for achieving large disease reductions while simultaneously limiting population growth, which may be advantageous in some management scenarios. However, the field effort required to find the small segment of the population that is infectious rather than susceptible or recovered will likely limit the utility of this approach in many free-ranging wildlife populations. Nevertheless, we encourage scientists and policy makers to consider sterilization as part of a suite of available brucellosis management tools.},

@article{fritz_carrying_1994,
	Abstract = {The effect of pastoral management on the standing crop biomass of large ungulates, an index of carrying capacity, is analysed at a regional level by using data compiled from published sources covering east and south Africa. The effect of primary production is controlled for by using two environmental factors, rainfall and soil nutrient availability, and the effect of species richness of the ungulate community is evaluated. The results confirm the dominant effect of rainfall, and demonstrate that soil nutrient levels also strongly affect the biomass of large ungulate communities. For a given level of rainfall, on rich soils (high nutrient availability) the biomass of large ungulates is about 20 times as great as on poor soils with low nutrient availability. The model based on rainfall and soil nutrient classes accounts for 87 \% of the variance in large ungulate biomass. Pastoral and natural ecosystems do not differ significantly in large ungulate biomass; there is therefore currently no evidence that extensive pastoral management increases carrying capacity for large ungulates above the levels observed in natural communities. Species richness, a measure of biodiversity, had a significant but very small effect on the biomass-rainfall relation in the complete data set. When analysed by pastoral management, the effect of this factor was significant for the set of natural ecosystems only. Pastoral management and species richness may therefore have compensatory effects. These results suggest that the carrying capacity is limited at the community, rather than the species, level.},

	Abstract = {Context. Lion (Panthera leo Linnaeus, 1758) populations experience a range of ecological and human influences that affect their demography. Few lion populations have reliable estimates of population size, trends in these, or demographic profiles. Threats such as those imposed by diseases are thus hard to evaluate and respond to. Aims. To calibrate call-up stations and de. ne survey effort required to achieve estimates with known precision, and extract age structures and estimate survival rates, to estimate lion numbers, sex and age structure and survival rates, and then to evaluate the effect of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) on estimates of lion density and survival. Methods. By using call-up stations, we developed a statistically robust approach to estimate selected population variables and evaluated the perceived threat of bTB in landscapes of varying prey biomass in the Kruger National Park. Key results. The size of the lion population was stable, although long intervals between present and historical estimates limit this conclusion. Density and survival rates associated positively with prey biomass, and a positive association was detected between the survival rate and bTB prevalence, with survival being higher in areas that had high prevalence of bTB. Male survival was lower than female survival, disregarding the effects of prey biomass or bTB prevalence. Body condition of lions was high, with scores lower at low to medium prey density. Conclusions. The effect of an exotic disease on the Kruger lion population may be negligible at present. Intraspecific competition in areas where lions live at high densities affects survival rate. However, droughts could disrupt the hierarchical influences of prey biomass and bTB prevalence on lion densities and survival. Implications. To evaluate the effect of an exotic disease on lion demography, population surveys should include age- and sex-structure assessments, complemented with focal studies of fecundity. This reflects the importance of understanding host-disease dynamics to inform management options.},

@article{owen-smith_shifting_2008,
	Abstract = {Shifting prey selection has been identified as a mechanism potentially regulating predator-prey interactions, but it may also lead to different outcomes, especially in more complex systems with multiple prey species available. We assessed changing prey selection by lions, the major predator for 12 large herbivore species in South Africa's Kruger National Park. The database was provided by records of found carcasses ascribed to kills by lions assembled over 70 years, coupled with counts of changing prey abundance extending over 30 years. Wildebeest and zebra constituted the most favored prey species during the early portion of the study period, while selection for buffalo rose in the south of the park after a severe drought increased their vulnerability. Rainfall had a negative influence on the proportional representation of buffalo in lion kills, but wildebeest and zebra appeared less susceptible to being killed under conditions of low rainfall. Selection by lions for alternative prey species, including giraffe, kudu, waterbuck, and warthog, was influenced by the changing relative abundance and vulnerability of the three principal prey species. Simultaneous declines in the abundance of rarer antelope species were associated with a sharp increase in selection for these species at a time when all three principal prey species were less available. Hence shifting prey selection by lions affected the dynamics of herbivore populations in different ways: promoting contrasting responses by principal prey species to rainfall variation, while apparently being the main cause of sharp declines by alternative prey species under certain conditions. Accordingly, adaptive responses by predators, to both the changing relative abundance of the principal prey species, and other conditions affecting the relative vulnerability of various species, should be taken into account to understand the interactive dynamics of multispecies predator-prey webs.},

@article{sharp_stable_2011,
	Abstract = {Prions, which cause chronic wasting disease and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in ungulates, can remain active in soils for years. The reproductive age of ungulate populations is well within the residence time of prions in the soil. Reproduction and mortality in disease-free wildlife populations is regulated by density-dependent mechanisms, which also underlie the concept of carrying capacity. Here, we present a model of a susceptible deer population with density-dependent population regulation, an infected population, and an environmental pool of prions that infect the susceptible animals. When carrying capacity is low, the disease does not persist. As carrying capacity increases beyond a critical level, chronic wasting disease then invades a susceptible population and persists. Further increases in carrying capacity beyond a second, higher critical level produce stable limit cycles and recurrent epidemics between the animal population and the disease. This model therefore extends Rosenzweig's paradox of enrichment for predator-prey models to models of diseases in populations. The critical carrying capacities are reached sooner as the residence time of the prion in the soil increases. Wildlife management programs which increase carrying capacity may cause chronic wasting disease to persist and even destabilize animal populations, especially where prions persist for many years.},

	Abstract = {It is known that macrophages from naturally resistant animals possess a strong immune response against bovine tuberculosis to control mycobacterial infections. In the present study, the macrophage phagocytic activity, intracellular bacterial survival, and cytokine gene expression induced by classical and alternative activators against Mycobacterium bovis in naturally resistant or susceptible bovines, were evaluated. Animals were classified as naturally resistant or susceptible based on the capacity of their macrophages to allow M. bovis (BCG) growth. Peripheral blood macrophages from naturally resistant and susceptible animals were activated by classical and alternative stimuli and challenged with either non-pathogenic M. bovis BCG strain or pathogenic 9926 strain. Naturally resistant animals showed the highest phagocytosis index and microbial control after classical and alternative stimuli, being this response higher against the strain 9926 than the non-virulent strain. In addition, the response of macrophages activated by the classical pathway was higher than that under the alternative activation against both types of strains. Furthermore, classical pathway-activated macrophages derived from naturally resistant animals expressed higher levels of the pro-inflammatory markers iNOS, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, MIP-1 and MIP-3, and the anti-inflammatory markers ARGII and TGF-b, particularly to BCG. The results of this study showed that macrophages from naturally resistant animals produced stronger pro-inflammatory responses than those from susceptible ones to signals provided by classical pathway activators. Its role in innate immunity against M. bovis is yet to be determined. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Altered assumptions about how different ecological factors limit population numbers may lead to different conclusions about the causes of decline and ultimate extinction of a small population. Here, alternative hypotheses for the local disappearance of the Serengeti plains study population of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) are examined in light of observations of density dependence, deterministic decline and frequent rapid fluctuations in population number. After a population crash from 60 individuals in 1975 to 30 individuals in 1976, the Serengeti plains population fluctuated around a mean value of 22 individuals for 16 years before local extinction occurred. Variation in population numbers was extreme, with inter-annual reductions in population size of at least 40\% occurring three times. Several explanations are consistent with the observed trends in population size including outbreaks of various epizootics and competition with other predators. Monte Carlo simulation, with parameters set to reflect observed fluctuations, demonstrate that population extinction was likely from chance factors alone. In small and declining populations, for which precise data and controls are unavailable, determining the cause(s) of extinction usually will be impossible.},

It is also known to cause tuberculosis disease in humans, a fact which has raised renewed concerns regarding the zoonotic risk for humans, especially those living at the animal-human interface. This review consolidates recent reports in the literature mainly on animal and zoonotic tuberculosis with an emphasis on evolution, epidemiology, treatment and diagnosis. The information presented reveals the fundamental differences in the complexity and level at which the disease affects the economy, ecosystem and human population of regions where animal tuberculosis control is achieved and regions where little or no control is implemented. In conclusion the review suggests that bovine tuberculosis has essentially been reduced to a disease of economic importance in the developed world, while low-income countries are facing a multifaceted impact which potentially affects the health of livestock, humans and ecosystems and which is likely to increase in the presence of debilitating diseases such as HIV/AIDS and other factors which negatively affect human livelihoods.},

	Abstract = {West Nile virus (WNV) has caused repeated large-scale human epidemics in North America since it was first detected in 1999 and is now the dominant vector-borne disease in this continent. Understanding the factors that determine the intensity of the spillover of this zoonotic pathogen from birds to humans (via mosquitoes) is a prerequisite for predicting and preventing human epidemics. We integrated mosquito feeding behavior with data on the population dynamics and WNV epidemiology of mosquitoes, birds, and humans. We show that Culex pipiens, the dominant enzootic (bird-to-bird) and bridge (bird-to-human) vector of WNV in urbanized areas in the northeast and north-central United States, shifted its feeding preferences from birds to humans by 7-fold during late summer and early fall, coinciding with the dispersal of its preferred host (American robins, Turdus migratorius) and the rise in human WNV infections. We also show that feeding shifts in Cx. tarsalis amplify human WNV epidemics in Colorado and California and occur during periods of robin dispersal and migration. Our results provide a direct explanation for the timing and intensity of human WNV epidemics. Shifts in feeding from competent avian hosts early in an epidemic to incompetent humans after mosquito infection prevalences are high result in synergistic effects that greatly amplify the number of human infections of this and other pathogens. Our results underscore the dramatic effects of vector behavior in driving the transmission of zoonotic pathogens to humans.},

@article{stewart_onchocerciasis_1999,
	Abstract = {Chronic helminth infection induces a type-2 cellular immune response. In contrast to this, mycobacterial infections commonly induce a type-1 immune response which is considered protective. Type-2 responses and diminished type-1 responses to mycobacteria have been previously correlated with active infection states such as pulmonary tuberculosis and lepromatous leprosy. The present study examines the immune responses of children exposed to both the helminth parasite Onchocerca volvulus and the mycobacterial infections, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. leprae. Proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and production of IL-4 in response to both helminth and mycobacterial antigen (PPD) decreased dramatically with increasing microfilarial (MF) density. Although interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production strongly correlated with cellular proliferation, it was surprisingly not related to MF density for either antigen. IL-4 production in response to helminth antigen and PPD increased with ascending children's age. IFN-γ and cellular proliferation to PPD were not related to age, but in response to helminth antigen were significantly higher in children of age 9--12 years than children of either the younger age group (5--8 years) or the older group (13--16 years). Thus, there was a MF density-related down-regulation of cellular responsiveness and age-related skewing toward type 2 which was paralleled in response to both the helminth antigen and PPD. This parasite-induced immunomodulation of the response to mycobacteria correlates with a previous report of doubled incidence of lepromatous leprosy in onchocerciasis hyperendemic regions. Moreover, this demonstration that helminth infection in humans can modulate the immune response to a concurrent infection or immunological challenge is of critical importance to future vaccination strategies.},

	Abstract = {The management of infectious diseases is an increasingly important public health issue, the effective implementation of which is often complicated by difficulties in teasing apart the relative roles of extrinsic and intrinsic factors influencing transmission. Dengue, a vector-borne strain polymorphic disease, is one such infection where transmission dynamics are affected by environmental variables as well as immune-mediated serotype interactions. To understand how alternative hypotheses concerning dengue infection and transmission may explain observed multiannual cycles in disease incidence, we adopt a theoretical approach that combines both ecological and immunological mechanisms. We demonstrate that, contrary to perceived wisdom, patterns generated solely by anti body-dependent enhancement or heterogeneity in virus virulence are not consistent with serotype-specific notification data in important ways. Furthermore, to generate epidemics with the characteristic signatures observed in data, we find that a combination of seasonal variation in vector demography and, crucially, a short-lived period of cross-immunity is sufficient. We then show how understanding the persistence and eradication of dengue serotypes critically depends on the alternative assumed mechanisms.},

A transient almost one-log elevation in HIV viral load occurs during febrile malaria episodes; in addition, susceptibility to malaria is enhanced in HIV-infected patients. A mathematical model applied to a setting in Kenya with an adult population of roughly 200,000 estimated that, since 1980, the disease interaction may have been responsible for 8,500 excess HIV infections and 980,000 excess malaria episodes. Co-infection might also have facilitated the geographic expansion of malaria in areas where HIV prevalence is high. Hence, transient and repeated increases in HIV viral load resulting from recurrent co-infection with malaria may be an important factor in promoting the spread of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.},

@article{graham_when_2002,
	Abstract = {Disease directly caused by immune system action is known as immunopathology. Many factors may lead the immune system to cause rather than cure disease, and autoimmune, allergic, and infection-related immunopathological diseases affect millions of people worldwide. This review presents an analysis of T-helper cell mediated, infection-related immunopathology within the framework of evolutionary ecology. A proximate cause of infection-related immunopathology is an error in the type of T-helper response induced. Distinct subsets of T-helper cells enable different effector mechanisms and therefore work optimally against different types of parasites (e.g., extracellular versus intracellular parasites). Immune responses that cure rather than cause disease require that the T-helper subset be tailored to the parasite. It is thus critical for the immunophenotype to match the "environment" of the parasitic infection. As in other cases of adaptive plasticity, a mismatch between an organism's phenotype and the selective environment can decrease fitness. T-helper response induction may be confounded by coinfeciton of a single host by multiple parasite species. Because of normally adaptive feedback loops that tend to polarize T-helper responses, it can become impossible for the immune system to mount effective, conflicting responses concurrently. Immunophenotype-environment mismatches may thus be inevitable when simultaneous, conflicting immune responses are required. An ultimate cause of infection-related immunopathology in a multi-parasite selection regime is the T-helper response polarization that can propagate response errors and constrain the ability of the immune system to resolve conflicting response requirements. A case study is sued to illustrate how coinfection can exacerbate immunopathology and to frame testable predictions about optimal responses to coinfection (e.g., is the observed joint response to coinfection accurately predicted by the average of the component single-infection optimal responses, where the single-infection optima are weighted by the contribution of each to fitness). The case study includes immunological and pathological data from mice infected by schistosoma mansoni alone and by S. mansoni in combination with Toxoplasma gondii. Such data can inform hypothesis tests of evolutionary ecological principles, and ecological analysis can in turn clarify assumptions about responses to coinfection for a greater understanding of the immune system. The synthesis of evolutionary ecology and immunology could therefore be of mutual benefit to the two disciplines.},

Three became infected by day 14, as indicated by the detection of M. bovis in nasal mucus. In-vitro interferon-gamma production and lymphocyte proliferation were detected after stimulation of peripheral blood with M. bovis antigens in the majority of in-contact animals by day 28; this provided support for the role of immunological mechanisms in pathogenesis. Tuberculous lesions were found in the submandibular and bronchomediastinal lymph nodes and in the lungs of the in-contact calves; in distribution and appearance the lesions resembled those observed in naturally occurring disease. The distribution of M. bovis antigen and the numbers of mycobacteria within pulmonary lesions are reported. (C) 1999 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Surveillance and control activities related to bovine tuberculosis (TB) in free-ranging, Michigan white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have been underway for over a decade, with significant progress. However, foci of higher TB prevalence on private lands and limited agency ability to eliminate them using broad control strategies have led to development and trial of new control strategies, such as live trapping, testing, and culling or release. Such strategries require a prompt, accurate live animal test,which has thus far been lacking. We report h ere the ability of seven candidate blood assays to determine the TB infection status of Michigan deer. Our aims were twofold: to characterize the accuracy of the tests using field-collected. samples and to evaluate the feasibility of the tests for use in a test-and-cull strategy. Samples were collected from 760 deer obtained via five diferent surveys conducted between 2004 and 2007. Blood samples were subjected to one or more or the candidate blood assays and evaluated against the results of mycobacterial culture of the cranial lymph nodes. Sensitivities of the tests ranged from 46\% to 68\%, whereas specificities and negative predictive values were all {\textgreater} 92\%. Positive predictive values were highly variable. An exploratory analysis of associations among several host and sampling-related factors and the agreement between blood assay and culture. results suggested these assays were minimally affected. This study demonstrated the capabilities and limitations of several available blood tests for Mycobacterium bovis on specimens obtained through a variety of field surveillance methods. Although these blood assays cannot replace mass culling, information on their performance may prove useful as wildlife disease managers develop innovative methods of detecting infected animals where mass culling is Publicly unacceptable and cannot be used as a control strategy.},

	Abstract = {An attenuated Mycobacterium bovis RD1 deletion (Delta RD1) mutant of the Ravenel strain was constructed, characterized, and sequenced. This M. bovis Delta RD1 vaccine strain administered to calves at 2 weeks of age provided similar efficacy as M. bovis bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) against low dose, aerosol challenge with virulent M. bovis at 3.5 months of age. Approximately 4.5 months after challenge, both Delta RD1- and BCG-vaccinates had reduced tuberculosis (TB)-associated pathology in lungs and lung-associated lymph nodes and M. bovis colonization of tracheobronchial lymph nodes as compared to non-vaccinates. Mean central memory responses elicited by either Delta RD1 or BCG prior to challenge correlated with reduced pathology and bacterial colonization. Neither Delta RD1 or BCG elicited IFN-gamma responses to rESAT-6:CFP-10 prior to challenge, an emerging tool for modern TB surveillance programs. The Delta RD1 strain may prove useful for bovine TB vaccine programs, particularly if additional mutations are included to improve safety and immunogenicity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{wyckoff_bovine_2002,
	Abstract = {The long-held paradigm of T lymphocyte-mediated activation of mononuclear phagocytes (Mo) as the major mechanism of protection against facultative intracellular pathogens such as Brucella has been modified to include killing of infected Mo by various subsets of T lymphocytes. Remnants of killed infected cells are phagocytosed by immunologically-activated Mo, which are much more efficient at killing such pathogens. Most of the detailed information regarding immunity in general and that of brucellosis specifically has been obtained using murine infection models rather than in cattle. However, there has been considerable definition of cellular phenotypes, cytokines and functional characteristics of T lymphocytes in cattle over the last decade. This was mainly due to development of monoclonal antibodies against cell surface markers and application of molecular cloning and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for isolation, characterization and detection of genes encoding bovine cytokines. This review discusses cellular and molecular immunity in bovine brucellosis as pertains to T lymphocyte interactions with the Mo. Although current knowledge directly obtained from brucellosis immunity studies in the bovine host is limited and incomplete, the many parallels between the bovine and murine immune systems allow for some extrapolation in the description of bovine host defense mechanisms. Direct information from studies with immunized cattle supports the concepts of coordinate activation of uninfected Mo and killing of Brucella-infected Mo by antigen-specific T lymphocytes as major mechanisms of host defense in bovine brucellosis. There also appears to be a bias in the T lymphocyte compartment towards recognition of particular bacterial stress proteins following immunization with live Brucella vaccines.

	Abstract = {The Brucella abortus type IV secretion system (T4SS), encoded by the virB operon, is essential for establishing persistent infection in the murine reticuloendothelial system. To gain insight into the in vivo interactions mediated by the T4SS, we compared host responses elicited by B. abortus with those of an isogenic mutant in the virB operon. Mice infected with the B. abortus virB mutant elicited smaller increases in serum levels of immunoglobulin G2a, gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), and interieukin-12p40 than did mice infected with wild-type B. abortus. Despite equal bacterial loads in the spleen, at 3 to 4 days postinfection, levels of IFN-gamma were higher in mice infected with wild-type B. abortus than in mice infected with the virB mutant, as shown by real-time PCR, intracellular cytokine staining, and cytokine levels. IFN-gamma-producing CD4(+) T cells were more abundant in spleens of mice infected with wild-type B. abortus than in virB mutant-infected mice. Similar numbers of IFN-gamma-secreting CD8(+) T cells were observed in the spleens of mice infected with B. abortus 2308 or a virB mutant. These results suggest that early differences in cytokine responses contribute to a stronger Th1 polarization of the immune response in mice infected with wild-type B. abortus than in mice infected with the virB mutant.},

	Abstract = {Parasitic helminths are ubiquitous in most host, including human, populations. Helminths often alter the likelihood of infection and disease progression of coinfecting microparasitic pathogens (viruses, bacteria, protozoa), and there is great interest in incorporating deworming into control programmes for many major diseases (e.g. HIV, tuberculosis, malaria). However, such calls are controversial; studies show the consequences of deworming for the severity and spread of pathogens to be highly variable. Hence, the benefits of deworming, although clear for reducing the morbidity due to helminth infection per se, are unclear regarding the outcome of coinfections and comorbidities. I develop a theoretical framework to explore how helminth coinfection with other pathogens affects host mortality and pathogen spread and evolution under different interspecific parasite interactions. In all cases the outcomes of coinfection are highly context-dependent, depending on the mechanism of helminth-pathogen interaction and the quantitative level of helminth infection, with the effects of deworming potentially switching from beneficial to detrimental depending on helminth burden. Such context-dependency may explain some of the variation in the benefits of deworming seen between studies, and highlights the need for obtaining a quantitative understanding of parasite interactions across realistic helminth infection ranges. However, despite this complexity, this framework reveals predictable patterns in the effects of helminths that may aid the development of more effective, integrated management strategies to combat pathogens in this coinfected world.},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure P-D for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general P-D approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding P-D to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

	Abstract = {Ecoimmunologists have made many important discoveries about the immune systems of wild animals including (1) immune activity is usually costly, (2) counter-intuitive decrements in immune activity are often due to trade-offs with other physiological activities or behaviors, and (3) immune activity is a currency by which sexually selected traits are indices of individual quality. The use of single assays to characterize "immunocompetence," however, as was, and is, the common practice in ecoimmunology, ignores the inherent complexity of the immune system and may have led to inappropriate conclusions or even positive publication bias. Recently, some have suggested that ecoimmunologists measure disease resistance or the fitness consequences of immunological insults instead of the immune system itself. We propose that researchers continue to use the techniques that have already been fruitful in ecoimmunology, but better incorporate the underlying immunophysiology of such techniques into their study designs and interpretation. We review the benefits and some recent successes of such an approach. Then, we discuss several under-explored but potentially rewarding areas of ecoimmunology, including development of the immune system, immunosenescence, and immunoredistribution. All three areas are well studied in biomedicine and are likely to be relevant in ecological contexts. For instance, because of the inherent costliness of immune defense and reproduction, variation in rates of development and senescence of the immune system likely impacts the ways in which individuals of different species mature and/or breed. Likewise, differential capacity to redistribute immune resources in response to changes within the endocrine system may explain some of the inconsistencies regarding the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis of sexual selection.},

@article{hawley_disease_2011-1,
	Abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Ecological immunology and disease ecology are two relatively young disciplines that apply ecological approaches and principles to traditionally non-ecological fields. In both cases, an ecological perspective has allowed new insights to emerge by focusing attention on variation over space and time, and by emphasizing the role of the environment in shaping individual responses and the outcome of host-pathogen interactions. Here we review the growing conceptual interface between these two rapidly evolving fields. 2. Areas of synergy between ecological immunology and disease ecology aim to translate variation in within-host processes (e.g. immunity) into between-host dynamics (e.g. parasite transmission). Emerging areas of synergy include potential immune mechanisms that underlie host heterogeneity in disease susceptibility, teasing apart the effects of environmental factors such as seasonality and climate on host susceptibility and pathogen dynamics, and predicting the outcome of co-infection by functionally distinct groups of parasites that elicit different immune responses. 3. In some cases, practical limitations have constrained the merging of ideas in ecological immunology and disease ecology. We discuss several logistical challenges, including dissecting the relative roles of host exposure and susceptibility, establishing links between measures of immunity and pathogen resistance in wild populations, and incorporating relevant immune variation into prevailing disease ecology modeling frameworks. 4. Future work at the interface of these two fields should advance understanding of life-history theory, host-pathogen dynamics, and physiological ecology, and will also contribute to targeted approaches for wildlife health and zoonotic disease prevention.},

	Abstract = {The present study was an investigation into the role of T lymphocytes in the killing of antigen-sensitized macrophages (M phi) in bovine brucellosis. Following confirmation of bovine T lymphocyte cell lines derived from Brucella abortus Strain 19 vaccinated steers as antigen-specific in proliferation studies using various antigens, we adapted an apoptosis assay for evaluation of cytotoxicity by these bovine T cells against autologous monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM phi)as target cells. Various B. abortus antigen preparations were tested including whole gamma-irradiated B. abortus bacteria (gamma BA), a soluble cytosolic protein fraction and a membrane-associated protein fraction. Both polyclonal and cloned T lymphocyte cell lines exhibited cytotoxicity against MDM phi targets in an antigen-specific fashion. Polyclonal and cloned T lymphocyte cell lines demonstrated cytotoxic responses to varying degrees against B. abortus antigens regardless of whether the antigen used was whole nonviable bacteria, a soluble protein extract or a membrane-associated fraction of extracted bacteria. To further develop correlation of these responses to an in vivo host defense mechanism, cytotoxicity was evaluated using target cells that had been infected with live B. abortus S 19 or B. abortus Strain 2308. Cytotoxic responses were also demonstrated consistently against infected targets with either strain of B. abortus although in most cases, cytotoxicity was higher against target cells sensitized with gamma BA compared to those infected with live bacteria. Cloned T lymphocyte cell lines were all CD4(+), CD8(-) cells indicating that the observed cytotoxic responses were most likely due to an inflammatory T(h)1 response and may represent an important host defense mechanism induced by vaccination with live attenuated strains of B. abortus in cattle.

	Abstract = {Individual humans and animals are subject to infection by a variety of parasites (broadly defined to include viruses, bacteria and other non-protozoan microparasites) at any one time. Multiple parasite infections occur frequently in populations of wild animals as well as in humans from developing countries. In some species and regions, hosts with multiple infections are more common than hosts with either no infection or a single infection. Studies, predominantly
on animals, show that a wide variety of environmental and host-dependent factors can influence the structure and dynamics of the communities of parasites that make up these multiple infections. In addition, synergistic and competitive interactions can occur between parasite species, which can influence the likelihood of their successful transmission to other hosts and increase or decrease their overall pathogenic impact. This review summarises aspects of our current knowledge on the frequency of multiparasite infections, the factors which influence them, and their pathogenic signifi- cance.},

	Abstract = {Objective: Many fundamental patterns of coinfection (multi-species infections) are undescribed, including the relative frequency of coinfection by various pathogens, differences between single-species infections and coinfection, and the burden of coinfection on human health. We aimed to address the paucity of general knowledge on coinfection by systematically collating and analysing data from recent publications to understand the types of coinfection and their effects. Methods: From an electronic search to find all publications from 2009 on coinfection and its synonyms in humans we recorded data on i) coinfecting pathogens and their effect on ii) host health and iii) intensity of infection. Results: The most commonly reported coinfections differ from infections causing highest global mortality, with a notable lack of serious childhood infections in reported coinfections. We found that coinfection is generally reported to worsen human health (76\% publications) and exacerbate infections (57\% publications). Reported coinfections included all kinds of pathogens, but were most likely to contain bacteria. Conclusions: These results suggest differences between coinfected patients and those with single infections, with coinfection having serious health effects. There is a pressing need to quantify the tendency towards negative effects and to evaluate any sampling biases in the coverage of coinfection research. (C) 2011 The British Infection Association.

@article{gogal_analysis_1997,
	Abstract = {An assessment of T-cell-mediated immune functions (i.e., lymphocyte proliferation assay) in the chicken, unlike the determination of antibody levels, is nor routinely performed. This is primarily because of difficulties in the isolation of relatively pure populations of lymphocytes and the use of radioactive isotopes. To address these issues, the goals of our study were to optimize a method for isolating and enriching avian lymphocyte populations and to develop a nonradioactive lymphocyte proliferation assay. To accomplish these goals, we used a multiple slow-speed centrifugation technique combined with a ''swirl'' collection technique for lymphocyte isolation from chicken peripheral blood. After a fraction enriched with lymphocytes was obtained, a simple, rapid colorimetric and fluorometric assay (lympho-pro) to indirectly determine mitogen-induced proliferation was adapted and compared with the ''Gold Standard'' [H-3]thymidine. Chickens of different ages and two genetic strains were used in this study. Lymphocytes were stimulated with various concentrations of concanavalin A (Con A, T-cell mitogen) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate + ionomycin (pan lymphocyte mitogen). Our studies showed that the pattern of lymphocyte proliferation assessed by the Alamar blue(TM)-based lympho-pro assay was similar to the [H-3]thymidine incorporation assay. Younger birds had higher levels of mitogen-induced proliferation when compared with adults of the same genetic strain. Because the lympho-pro assay, unlike [H-3]thymidine, does not require lysis of cells to assess proliferation, cells that have undergone stimulation/proliferation can be subsequently characterized by staining with antibodies against cell surface antigens and analysis by flow cytometry. Another notable advantage of the lympho-pro assay is the rapidity of assessment and nontoxicity. In conclusion, this assay may be of value in assessing some aspects of T-cell-mediated immunity in both avian research and avian medicine diagnostic settings.},

	Abstract = {Immune evasion is essential for Brucella abortus to survive in the face of robust adaptive CD4+ T cell response. We have previously demonstrated that B. abortus can indirectly inhibit CD4+ T cells by down-regulating MHC-II expression and antigen presentation on macrophages. However, whether B. abortus is able to directly interfere with T lymphocytes is not known. We report here that B. abortus induces apoptosis of human T lymphocytes, even though invasion of T lymphocytes was low and non-replicative. The ability of heat-killed B. abortus to reproduce the same phenomenon suggested that there was a bacterial structural component involved. We demonstrated that a prototypical B. abortus outer membrane lipoprotein (L-Omp19), but not its unlipidated form, induced T lymphocyte apoptosis. Moreover, a synthetic lipohexapeptide that mimics the structure of the protein lipid moiety also induced an increase in T lymphocyte cell death, indicating that the structural component implicated in the phenomenon could be any B. abortus lipoprotein. B. abortus-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis was dependent on the secretion of TNF-alpha since pre-incubation of T lymphocytes with anti-TNF-alpha mAb inhibited the apoptosis of the cells. Overall, these results represent a new mechanism whereby B. abortus by directly inhibiting T cell-mediated responses may evade adaptive immune responses.

	Abstract = {Brucella abortus elicits a vigorous Th1 immune response which activates cytotoxic T lymphocytes. However, B.abortus persists in its hosts in the presence of CD8+ T cells, establishing a chronic infection. Here, we report that B.abortus infection of human monocytes/macrophages inhibited the IFN--induced MHC-I cell surface expression. This phenomenon was dependent on metabolically active viable bacteria. MHC-I down-modulation correlated with the development of diminished CD8+ cytotoxic T cell response as evidenced by the reduced expression of the activation marker CD107a on CD8+ T lymphocytes and a diminished percentage of IFN--producing CD8+ T cells. Inhibition of MHC-I expression was not due to changes in protein synthesis. Rather, we observed that upon B.abortus infection MHC-I molecules were retained within the Golgi apparatus. Overall, these results describe a novel mechanism based on the intracellular sequestration of MHC-I molecules whereby B.abortus would avoid CD8+ cytotoxic T cell responses, evading their immunological surveillance.},

PBMC from 14 patients proliferated in response to CP (responder patients [RPs]) and cells from 11 patients did not (nonresponder patients [NRPs]). CP-specific interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon-gamma were significantly induced in PBMC from RPs, compared with cells from NRPs. No significant differences were found in the production of IL-10 between the 2 groups. CP did not induce IL-4 production. A close relationship was observed between the clinical status of the patients and the T cell response against CP. Patient with acute infections responded to CP and induced production of T helper 1 (Th1) cytokines, whereas chronically infected patients did not. Diminished production of Th1 cytokines may contribute to T cell unresponsiveness in chronic human brucellosis.},

	Abstract = {The aim of the present study was to determine the cellular immune response on the course of brucellosis by investigating the proliferation response of T-cell subsets to phytohemagglutinin (PHA), that is, nonspecific rnitogen in the patients with acute and chronic brucellosis. The study was performed in 19 patients with untreated brucellosis (acute, n = 11; chronic, n = 8) and 19 healthy controls. Standard tube agglutination and Coombs tests for brucellosis were performed. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell were investigated by the flow cytometry and sorting methods in all of cases. After these cells were cultured and stimulated with PHA, [H-3]-thymidine uptake and stimulation indices (SIs) were established. In all of the patients with brucellosis, CD4+ SIs and CD8+ SIs were found to be 1.40 0.63 and 1.45 + 0.42, respectively, and in the controls CD4+ SIs and CD8+ Sls were 1.59 +/- 0.36 and 1.64 +/- 0.37, respectively. In acute cases, CD4+ Sls were 1.71 +/- 0.64 and CD8+ Sis were 1.54 +/- 0.45. CD4+ SIs were 0.97 +/- 0.25 and CD8+ Sls were 1.32 +/- 0.37 in chronic cases. Although in acute cases CD4+ SIs and CD8+ SIs were not different from those in the control group, CD4+ SIs of chronic brucellosis cases were found to be significantly low as compared with those of acute brucellosis cases and the controls (P {\textless} 0.01). CD8+ SIs of acute and chronic brucellosis cases were not found to be different from those in the controls. Brucella agglutination titers of the patients with acute and chronic brucellosis were not found related with CD4 SIs and CD8 Sls. The findings of significantly low results of CD4+ T-cell proliferative responses of chronic brucellosis to PHA as compared with control and acute brucellosis cases remind that the development of chronic infection might be a result of T-helper proliferation defect.

	Abstract = {The innate immune system constitutes an efficient defense mechanism against invading microbial pathogens. Recent studies have revealed the intracellular signaling cascades involved in the TLR-initiated immune response to Brucella spp. infection. However, there is a piece of the puzzle missing that is the role of non-TLR receptors in innate immunity. The involvement of TLR receptors in brucellosis has been investigated by different research groups. It was demonstrated that TLR2 clearly does not play any role in controlling Brucella abortus infection in vivo, whereas TLR9 has been shown to be required for clearance of this bacterium in infected mice. The participation of adaptor molecules, such as MyD88 and TRIF has also been discussed. Recently, we and others have reported the critical role of MyD88- and not TRIF-mediated signaling in dendritic cell maturation and in vivo resistance during B. abortus infection. However, the relationship between specific Brucella molecules and non-TLR receptors and signal transduction pathways needs to be better understood. It is now clear that the interaction between TLRs and recently identified cytosolic innate immune sensors is crucial for mounting effective immune responses. Finally, this review discusses the mechanisms used by Brucella to escape detection by the host innate immune system. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Objective: To identify characteristic features of tuberculosis in patients with culture proven brucellosis. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on patients diagnosed with culture proven brucellosis between January and December 2011, based on review of their medical records. Patients with demonstrable co-infection with tuberculosis were excluded. Clinical features, laboratory parameters and tissue histopathology reports where available were noted. Results: Thirty two patients with brucellosis were included in the study. Twenty one (65.63\%) patients had chronic fever, thirteen (40.63\%) had a productive cough, while significant weight loss, evening rise of temperature and night sweats were reported by eight (25.00\%), eleven (34.38\%) and five (15.63\%) patients respectively. Nine (28.13\%) patients had at least three of these symptoms. Lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were noted on examination in seven (21.88\%), fifteen (46.88\%) and twelve (37.50\%) patients respectively. Eight (25.00\%) patients had hepato splenomegaly, of these only two had associated significant lymphadenopathy. Respiratory examination was normal in all patients. Elevated ESR greater than 50 mm/hr was seen in eight (25.00\%), it was greater than 100 mm/hr in five (15.63\%) patients. Hypergammaglobulinemia was seen in eight (25.00\%) cases. Bone marrow biopsy showed non caseating granulomas in three (9.38\%) cases, lymph node biopsy showed granulomas in one case. Overall, three (9.38\%) patients had known risk factors for tuberculosis, while six (18.75\%) had risk factors for brucellosis. Conclusions: There is a clear overlap between brucellosis and tuberculosis both in terms of clinical presentation and laboratory parameters. It is essential to carefully rule out tuberculosis in all cases of suspected or proven brucellosis before initiating antimicrobial therapy, in order to forestall development of drug resistant tuberculosis.},

	Abstract = {Isolated pancreatic tuberculosis is an extremely rare clinical entity and is difficult to diagnose particularly in immunocompetent individuals. Clinical findings and symptomatology of brucellosis are often similar to tuberculosis thus making the differentiation amongst the two entities difficult. We report a case of pancreatic tuberculosis with systemic brucellosis in a 29 year old veterinarian who presented with epigastric pain and loss of appetite. Initial investigations revealed leukocytosis with moderately elevated transaminase, gamma glutamyl transferase, amylase and lipase levels. Imaging studies revealed an anechoic multiloculated cyst in the body and tail of the pancreas. Given the patient's occupational risk coupled with the presence of a positive Brucella agglutination test (with a titer of 1:320); a diagnosis of pancreatitis secondary to brucellosis was given. In addition to standard pancreatitis therapy of bowel rest with intravenous fluid/electrolyte replacement, anti-brucellosis therapy was also administered. The patient's initial response to therapy was positive however, 6 weeks into therapy, his abdominal pain recurred and repeat CT scan revealed the development of a pseudocyst in the pancreas. After failing a second attempt at conservative supportive therapy, the patient underwent an explorative laparotomy. Histological examination of the resected pancreatic specimen showed necrosis and was positive for tuberculosis by polymerase chain reaction. Herein, we describe the first case reported in the medical literature of the coexistence of systemic brucellosis with pancreatic tuberculosis. We suggest that the possibility of the coexistence of brucellosis with tuberculosis be kept in mind when assessing pancreatitis patients in endemic regions and in individuals with occupational risk hazards.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary ecology has developed along two major conceptual avenues, starting from the observation that hosts vary in their immune defence against parasites The first avenue, rooted in life-history theory, assumes fitness costs of immune defence and tradeoffs in the face of limited resources, rather than specific host-parasite interactions. The second avenue focuses on specific responses, especially those generated by genotype-genotype interaction between and within host and parasite species. Specificity in the interactions between hosts and parasites play a crucial role in the field but analysis is difficult. Here, we classify concepts about host-parasite interactions into these two families and discuss their reconciliation with the help of a defence component model and two-dimensional classification scheme of the individual components. This helps to clarify some of the confusing terminology and might guide further research in the field.},

@article{martin_trade-offs_2006,
	Abstract = {1. In many vertebrates, immune activity is compromised when other expensive activities are concurrent. One explanation for such patterns includes trade-offs between immune activity and other expensive physiological processes. Trade-offs among different immune responses themselves may also occur, but thus far few data exist to substantiate them. 2. We predicted that immune activity in female White-footed Mice, Peromyscus leucopus, would be weak (relative to sham-treated controls) if another immune response was already ongoing. To test this hypothesis, we examined (i) the effects of inflicting a cutaneous wound on cell-mediated immune activity one day after wounding, and (ii) the effects of inducing cell-mediated immune activity on the cutaneous wound-healing process when wounds were inflicted one day after the immune challenge. 3. Prior wounding dampened cell-mediated immune responses and induction of cell-mediated immune activity altered progression of wound healing. Immune challenges did not affect reproductive tissue masses, however, as has been detected in males of this species. Also, concentrations of circulating glucocorticoids, which are known modulators of immune activity, were not dramatically different between treatment and sham groups. 4.In sum, our results provide evidence that some immune responses can negatively influence other recent immunological activity. Further study is warranted, however, to pinpoint the molecular mechanisms underlying these apparent trade-offs and determine whether induction of immune activity may sometimes prime instead of hinder subsequent immune responses.},

@article{martin_immune_2007-1,
	Abstract = {Immune activity is variable within and among vertebrates despite the potentially large fitness costs of pathogens to their hosts. From the perspective of life history theory, immunological variability may be the consequence of counterbalancing investments in immune defense against other expensive physiological processes, namely, reproduction. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that immune defense among captive-bred, disease-free Peromyscus mice would be influenced by their reproductive life history strategies. Specifically, we expected that small species that reproduce prolifically and mature rapidly (i.e., fast pace of life) would favor inexpensive, nonspecific immune defenses to promote reproductive proclivity. Alternatively, we expected that large species that mature slowly and invest modestly in reproduction over multiple events (i.e., slow pace of life) would favor developmentally expensive, specific immune defenses and avoid cheap, nonspecific ones because such defenses are predisposed to self-damage. We found that species exhibited either strong ability to kill ( gram-negative) bacteria, a developmentally inexpensive defense, or strong ability to produce antibodies against a novel protein, a developmentally expensive defense, but not both. Cell-mediated inflammation also varied significantly among species, but in a unique fashion relative to bacteria killing or antibody production; wound healing was comparatively similar among species. These results indicate that Peromyscus species use immune strategies that are constrained to a dominant axis, but this axis is not determined solely by reproductive pace of life. Further comparisons, ideally with broader phylogenetic coverage, could identify what ecological and evolutionary forces produce the pattern we detected. Importantly, our study indicates that species may not be differentially immunocompetent; rather, they use unique defense strategies to prevent infection.},

	Abstract = {1. Immune defence has recently been viewed as a life-history trait that shows trade-offs with other life-history traits. However, studies exploring correlations between different components of immune defence and other life-history traits are scarce. 2. In this study, two measures of immune function, body size, and development time were studied in the Mediterranean Field Cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus. 3. We found no differences between the sexes, but differences in the correlation between the measure of immune function, development time, and body size. In both sexes, encapsulation rate was negatively correlated with body size and development time, whereas lytic enzyme activity was positively correlated with these two traits. Furthermore, encapsulation rate and lytic activity were themselves negatively correlated. 4. These results indicate that there is no single trait that can be termed 'immunocompetence' and that an understanding of trade-offs between the different types of immune function and life-history traits will require a more detailed analysis of the physiological basis of the traits.},

	Abstract = {To quantify the sensitivity and specificity of a serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and fecal culture (FC) tests and to estimate the prevalence of Johne's disease (JD) in New Zealand dairy herds using Bayesian methods, 4 New Zealand dairy herds were tested simultaneously by ELISA and FC 5 times over 3 lactations. Test results were dichotomized. A Bayesian regression model was developed that considered test sensitivity as a function of the covariates parity, lactation stage, and prevalence of JD, which is expected to vary between herds. It was applied to a cross-sectional subset of the data and the full, repeated measures data set. Results were compared with frequentist pseudo gold standard results of the full data. Using the regression model, sensitivity of the ELISA was higher in older animals, but the sensitivity of the FC test showed no trend across age groups. Both FC and ELISA sensitivity were lower in late lactation. Estimated prevalence was lower and FC sensitivity higher when analyzing the complete data. The regression model enabled a more accurate diagnosis of JD to be made because it incorporated cow-specific information in the diagnosis, such as age and lactation stage. The model also enabled the incorporation of previous test results for an individual when diagnosing disease. The trends in results from the regression model support the current understanding of the disease process. The advantage of repeated testing of individuals in the assessment of test performance is discussed in the current study.},

@article{georgiadis_correlation-adjusted_2003,
	Abstract = {Models for multiple-test screening data generally require the assumption that the tests are independent conditional on disease state. This assumption may be unreasonable, especially when the biologic basis of the tests is the same. We propose a model that allows for correlation between two diagnostic test results. Since models that incorporate test correlation involve more parameters than can be estimated with the available data, posterior inferences will depend more heavily on prior distributions, even with large sample sizes. If we have reasonably accurate information about one of the two screening tests (perhaps the standard currently-used test) or the prevalences of the tested populations, accurate inferences about all the parameters, including the test correlation, are possible. In this paper, we present a model for evaluating dependent diagnostic tests and analyze real and simulated data sets. Our analysis shows that when the tests are correlated, a model that assumes conditional independence can perform very poorly. We recommend that, if the tests are only moderately accurate and measure the same biological responses, researchers use the dependence model for their analyses.},

Sixteen heifers were experimentally infected with Brucella abortus biovar 1 ({\textregistered}ve heifers), Brucella suis biovar 2 (two heifers), Y. enterocolitica O:9 (six heifers) and Y. enterocolitica O:3 (three heifers). Four heifers, naturally infected with Y. enterocolitica O:9 that presented aspeci{\textregistered}c brucellosis serological reactions were also included in the experiment. A self-limited infection was induced in cattle by B. suis biovar 2. All the brucellosis serological tests used, i.e. the slow agglutination test (SAW), the Rose Bengal test (RB), the complement {\textregistered}xation test (CFT), indirect and competitive ELISA's, lacked speci{\textregistered}city when used to analyze sera from Y. enterocolitica O:9 infected animals. A Yersinia outer membrane proteins (YOPs)-ELISA was also used and although the test is able to detect a Yersinia group infection, it provided no evidence of whether or not there is a possible brucellosis infection when dual infections are present. The brucellergen IFN-g test showed a lack of speci{\textregistered}city also. The only test that was proven to be speci{\textregistered}c is the brucellergen skin test. All brucellosis serological tests, except the indirect ELISA, were limited in their ability to detect B. abortus persistently infected animals.
Based on these experimental studies, a strategy was implemented as part of the year 2001 Belgian Brucellosis Eradication Program to substantiate the eradication of bovine brucellosis. Epidemiolo- gical inquiries have identi{\textregistered}ed risk factors associated with aspeci{\textregistered}c serological reactions, possible transmission and infection of cattle by B. suis biovar 2 from infected wild boars; and both legal and administrative measures taken by the veterinary services. No cases of bovine brucellosis have been con{\textregistered}rmed in Belgium since March 2000.},

Fifty-eight deer died: 12 due to predation, 6 due to malnutrition, 14 due to other or unknown sources, and 26 killed by hunters (including 1 that was poached). Analysis of mortality indicated rates of annual nonhunting mortality were 0.19 (SE = 0.09) for adult females, 0.00 (SE = 0.05) for adult males and yearling females, and 0.16 (SE = 0.07) for yearling males. Hunting mortality was 0.04 (SE = 0.10) for adult females, 0.72 (SE = 0.12) for adult males, 0.12 (SE = 0.09) for yearling females, and 0.47 (SE = 0.10) for yearling males. Hunting mortality was higher among males in both age classes (P {\textless} 0.01) though nonhunting mortality was equivalent (P greater than or equal to 0.05). Seasonal mortality rates of males and females differed during the fall (P {\textless} 0.001), coincident with Michigan's hunting seasons. Hunting mortality was significantly higher for yearling and adult males due to hunting regulations that limited harvest of antlerless deer; consequently, adult sex ratios were skewed towards females.},

	Abstract = {Yellowstone bison (Bison bison bison) are managed to reduce the risk of brucellosis (Brucella abortus) transmission to cattle while allowing some migration out of Yellowstone National Park to winter ranges in Montana. Intensive management near conservation area boundaries maintained separation between bison and cattle, with no transmission of brucellosis. However, brucellosis prevalence in the bison population was not reduced and the management plan underestimated bison abundance, distribution, and migration, which contributed to larger risk management culls (total {\textgreater}3000 bison) than anticipated. Culls differentially affected breeding herds and altered gender structure, created reduced female cohorts, and dampened productivity. The ecological future of plains bison could be significantly enhanced by resolving issues of disease and social tolerance for Yellowstone bison so that their unique wild state and adaptive capabilities can be used to synergize the restoration of the species. We recommend several adaptive management adjustments that could be implemented to enhance the conservation of plains bison and reduce brucellosis infection. These findings and recommendations are pertinent to wood bison (Bison bison athabascae), European bison (Bison bonasus), and other large ungulates worldwide that are managed using best practices within a risk framework.

@article{bricker_pcr_2002,
	Abstract = {Numerous PCR-based assays have been developed for the identification of Brucella to improve diagnostic capabilities. Collectively, the repertoire of assays addresses several aspects of the diagnostic process. For some purposes, the simple identification of Brucella is adequate (e.g. diagnosis of human brucellosis or contamination of food products). In these cases, a genus-specific PCR assay is sufficient. Genus-specific assays tend to be simple, robust, and somewhat permissive of environmental influences. The main genetic targets utilized for these applications are the Brucella BCSP31 gene and the 16S-23S rRNA operon. Other instances require identification of the Brucella species involved. For example, most government-sponsored brucellosis eradication programs include regulations that stipulate a species-specific response. For epidemiological trace back, strain-specific identification is helpful. Typically, differential PCR-based assays tend to be more complex and consequently more difficult to perform. Several strategies have been explored to differentiate among Brucella species and strains, including locus specific multiplexing (e.g. AMOS-PCR based on IS711), PCR-RFLP (e.g. the omp2 locus), arbitrary-primed PCR, and ERIC-PCR to name a few. This paper reviews some of the major advancements in molecular diagnostics for Brucella including the development of procedures designed for the direct analysis of a variety of clinical samples. While the progress to date is impressive, there is still room for improvement. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {In the last half century, significant attention has been given to animal diseases; however, our understanding of disease processes and how to manage them at the livestock-wildlife interface remains limited. In this study, we conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature to evaluate the status of diseases at the livestock-wildlife interface in the United States. Specifically, the goals of the literature review were three fold: first to evaluate domestic animal diseases currently found in the United States where wildlife may play a role; second to identify critical issues faced in managing these diseases at the livestock-wildlife interface; and third to identify potential technical and policy strategies for addressing these issues. We found that of the 86 avian, ruminant, swine, poultry, and lagomorph diseases that are reportable to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), 53 are present in the United States; 42 (79\%) of these have a putative wildlife component associated with the transmission, maintenance, or life cycle of the pathogen; and 21 (40\%) are known to be zoonotic. At least six of these reportable diseases bovine tuberculosis, paratuberculosis, brucellosis, avian influenza, rabies, and cattle fever tick (vector control) have a wildlife reservoir that is a recognized impediment to eradication in domestic populations. The complex nature of these systems highlights the need to understand the role of wildlife in the epidemiology, transmission, and maintenance of infectious diseases of livestock. Successful management or eradication of these diseases will require the development of cross-discipline and institutional collaborations. Despite social and policy challenges, there remain opportunities to develop new collaborations and new technologies to mitigate the risks posed at the livestock-wildlife interface.

	Abstract = {Models for multiple-test screening data generally require the assumption that the tests are independent conditional on disease state. This assumption may be unreasonable, especially when the biological basis of the tests is the same. We propose a model that allows for correlation between two diagnostic test results. Since models that incorporate test correlation involve more parameters than can be estimated with the available data, posterior inferences will depend more heavily on prior distributions, even with large sample sizes. If we have reasonably accurate information about one of the two screening tests (perhaps the standard currently used test) or the prevalences of the populations tested, accurate inferences about all the parameters, including the test correlation, are possible. We present a model for evaluating dependent diagnostic tests and analyse real and simulated data sets. Our analysis shows that, when the tests are correlated, a model that assumes conditional independence can perform very poorly. We recommend that, if the tests are only moderately accurate and measure the same biological responses, researchers use the dependence model for their analyses.},

Serum samples obtained from heart blood of 1,000 sows from Iowa were examined for T gondii antibodies by use of the modified agglutination test (MAT), latex agglutination test (LAT), indirect hemagglutination test (IHAT), and ELISA. Toxoplasma gondii was isolated from 170 hearts of 1,000 sows by bioassays in mice and cats. The percentage of samples diagnosed as positive for each of the serologic tests was: MAT = 22.2\% (titer greater than or equal to 1:20), IHAT = 6.4\% (titer greater than or equal to 1:64), LAT = 10.4\% (titer greater than or equal to 1: 64), and ELISA = 24.1\% (OD {\textgreater} 0.360). The sensitivity and specificity of these tests were calculated respectively to be: 82.9 and 90.29\% for MAT, 29.4 and 98.3\% for IHAT, 45.9 and 96.9\% for LAT, and 72.9 and 85.9\% for ELISA. The dye test was run at 1:20 dilution on only 893 sera because of bacterial contamination and presence of anticomplement substances. Dye test antibodies were found in 17.8\% of the sera, and sensitivity and specificity were 54.4 and 90.8\%, respectively. Thus, the MAT had the highest sensitivity among all serologic tests used.},

	Abstract = {1. Infectious diseases seriously threaten the populations of many endangered mammals, including African wild dogs Lycaon pictus. Extinction risks may be particularly high where the endangered host lives alongside a more abundant host species which can maintain infection with virulent pathogens. Domestic dogs Canis familiaris are often assumed to act as such 'reservoir hosts' for pathogens threatening wild dogs. 2. We present the first empirical study of contact within and between populations of sympatric wild dogs and domestic dogs. We studied the densities and movement patterns of both species in a Kenyan rangeland, using Global Positioning System-collars and conventional radiotelemetry. 3. Wild dogs lived at low population densities, and direct encounters between packs were rare. In contrast, domestic dogs lived at higher densities and encountered one another more frequently. These differences suggest that directly transmitted virulent pathogens would be more likely to persist within populations of domestic dogs than within wild dog populations. However, wild dog populations alone might maintain pathogens that are indirectly transmitted through vectors or environmental persistence. 4. The risk of contact between the two host species was limited by their behaviour: domestic dogs were associated with human settlements, which wild dogs avoided. Clustering of settlements, reflecting grazing traditions of local pastoralists, accentuated these patterns. 5. We predict that, in this landscape, spillover of directly transmitted pathogens from domestic dogs to wild dogs might be infrequent and rarely followed by onward transmission to other wild dog packs. This may explain the recent growth of the local wild dog population despite sporadic cases of rabies. 6. Synthesis and applications. In this study area, the behaviour of wild and domestic dogs, combined with local land use practices, appeared to limit interspecific disease transmission and hence promote the recovery of the African wild dog population. However, different patterns may occur elsewhere. Moreover, land use changes like those occurring in other African rangelands would undermine such conservation benefits.},

This needs to be remedied to provide more cost-effective use of vaccines and more effective control. At population level, protective effects of immunisation can extend well beyond the individual, influencing the dynamics of viral propagation within the whole population, non-vaccinated as well as vaccinated. This concept of herd immunity and application of the resulting epidemiological principles, combined with experience gained from disease control programmes such as the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme has much to offer in designing effective science-based control programmes. This paper explores practical exploitation of the herd immunity principle by considering some of the factors which militate against mass vaccination achieving effective levels of herd immunity and, with these in mind, suggesting ways to optimise the efficiency of mass vaccination programmes.},

Methods and Results: The number of B. abortus present in the milk (CFU per nil) from 500 water buffaloes was measured by the Culture. Each animal was tested three times, at one month intervals. The presence or the absence of B. abortus in each milk sample was confirmed by PCR. A majority of infected animals shed the pathogen at a low level ({\textless}= 10(3) CFU ml(-1)). However, a few infected individuals (superspreaders) shed large numbers of B. abortus ({\textgreater}= 1(0)4 CFU ml(-1)). Quantitative PCR of B. abortus positive milk samples gave comparable results to Culture. Culling of the superspreaders was sufficient to arrest the spread of infection. Significance and Impact of the Study: The approach described here can reduce significantly the cost of controlling brucellosis. Culture and quantitative PCR tests identify superspreaders and, compared with the serological tests in use to detect brucellosis, provide also a more accurate estimate of the disease incidence.},

	Abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), the causative agent of Johne disease in cattle and other ruminants, is proposed to be at least one of the causes of Crohn disease in humans. MAP and Mycobacterium avium subspecies avium, a closely related opportunistic environmental bacterium, share 95\% of their genes and exhibit homologies of more than 99\% between these genes. The identification of molecules specific for MAP is essential for understanding its pathogenicity and for development of useful diagnostic tools. The application of gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance led to the structural identification of a major cell wall lipopeptide of MAP, termed Para-LP-01, defined as C20 fatty acyl-D-Phe-N-Me-L-Val-L-Ile-L-Phe-L-Ala methyl ester. Variations of this lipopeptide with different fatty acyl moieties (C16 fatty acyl through C17, C18, C19, C21 to C22) were also identified. Besides the specificity of this lipopeptide for MAP, the presence of an N-Me-L-valine represents the first reported N-methylated amino acid within an immunogenic lipopeptide of mycobacteria. Sera from animals with Johne disease, but not sera from uninfected cattle, reacted with this lipopeptide, indicating potential biological importance.},

	Abstract = {We review the principles and practical application of receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for diagnostic tests. ROC analysis can be used for diagnostic tests with outcomes measured on ordinal, interval or ratio scales. The dependence of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity on the selected cut-off value must be considered for a full test evaluation and for test comparison. All possible combinations of sensitivity and specificity that can be achieved by changing the test's cut- off value can be summarised using a single parameter; the area under the ROC curve. The ROC technique can also be used to optimise cut-off values with regard to a given prevalence in the target population and cost ratio of false-positive and false-negative results. However, plots of optimisation parameters against the selected cut-off value provide a more-direct method for cut-off selection. Candidates for such optimisation parameters are linear combinations of sensitivity and specificity (with weights selected to reflect the decision-making situation), odds ratio, chance-corrected measures of association (e.g. kappa) and likelihood ratios. We discuss some recent developments in ROC analysis, including meta-analysis of diagnostic tests, correlated ROC curves (paired-sample design) and chance- and prevalence-corrected ROC curves.},

Repeated measurements from three diagnostic tests for foot-and-mouth disease, applied to vaccinated and experimentally infected cattle, were analyzed. At any time the true disease status of the individuals was unknown, i.e., no gold standard was available. The model allows for correlation between repeated test results, in consequence of the underlying structure for the unknown true disease status, but also by the distribution of the test results conditional upon true disease status. The model also allows for dependence between the different diagnostic tests conditional upon true disease status. Prior information about the structure of the prevalence and the specificity of the tests was incorporated in a Bayesian analysis. Posterior inference was carried out with Markov chain Monte Carlo. Simulated data were analyzed to gain insight into the performance of the posterior Bayesian inference. The simulated data are typical for the expensive and, therefore, modestly sized infection experiments that are conducted under controlled conditions.},

	Abstract = {Serological methods are traditionally used in diagnosis of brucellosis. However, the comparative performance of these tests and their accuracy under the local environment in Zambia has not been assessed. Thus, the objective of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of three serological tests for brucellosis; Rose Bengal Test (RBT), competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) and Fluorescence Polarisation Assay (FPA) in naturally infected cattle in Zambia without an appropriate reference test to classify animals into truly infected and non-infected. Serological test results from a study to determine sero-prevalence were used to compare the performance of RBT, c-ELISA and FPA in diagnosing brucellosis in traditional cattle. Since none of the tests can be seen as a perfect reference test or gold standard, their performance in a population of naturally infected cattle was evaluated using latent class analysis which allows the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) to be estimated in the absence of a gold standard. The highest Se was achieved by the c-ELISA (97\%; Credible Posterior Interval (CPI) = 93-100\%) and the highest Sp by the FPA (93\%; CPI = 85-99\%), Conversely these tests also had the lowest Sp and Se, respectively, with the RBT performing well in both the Se (93\%; CPI = 84-98\%) and Sp (81 \%; CPl = 61-97).

	Abstract = {This article presents a model to evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic tests. Data from three tests for the detection of EF-positive Streptococcus suis serotype 2 strains in sows were analyzed. The data were collected in a field study in the absence of a gold standard, that is, the true disease status (noninfected or infected) of the tested animals was unknown. Two tests were based on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR); one test was applied to a tonsil swab (taken from the live animal), and the other test was applied to the whole tonsil (collected at slaughter). The third test was based on a bacterial examination (BE) of the whole tonsil. To reduce experimental cost BE was performed only fora subset of the animals in the sample. The model allows for dependence between tests, conditional upon the unknown true disease status of the animals. Accuracy was expressed in terms of sensitivity and specificity of the tests. A Bayesian analysis was performed that incorporated prior information about the accuracy of the tests. The model parameters have a simple interpretation and specification of priors is straightforward. Posterior inference was carried out with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, employing the Gibbs sampler, as implemented in the WinBUGS program. Different parameterizations to allow for selection and missing values, use of different priors, practical problems in the analysis, and some interesting issues in a joint analysis of the binary (positive or negative) results of PCR and BE and two additional continuous enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are discussed.},

@article{toft_evaluation_2007,
	Abstract = {Maedi-Visna virus (MVV) infection in sheep is present in several European countries, including Norway. The current Norwegian surveillance and control programme for MVV infection uses three serological tests: an agar gel immunodiffusion test (AGID) and two commercially available indirect ELISAs (Institut Pourquier, P-ELISA and HYPHEN BioMed, H-ELISA). From 18 flocks with suspected or confirmed MVV infection, sera from naturally infected sheep were obtained, and sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the three tests were estimated in absence of a perfect reference test using latent class models in a Bayesian analysis. The AGID had higher Sp (95\% posterior credibility interval (PCI) [98.4; 99.9]) than either ELISA (95\% PCI: P-ELISA, [95.1; 99.0]; H-ELISA, [91.4; 96.6]), but much lower Se (95 \% PCL AGID, [41.4; 59.8]; P-ELISA, [92.7; 100.0]; HELISA, [90.9; 99.4]). Currently the P-ELISA is used for screening and positive samples are subsequently confirmed by a setup using all three tests in a serial reading. The Se and Sp of the serial interpretations with and without the H-ELISA were estimated. The results suggested that the H-ELISA could be dropped as a confirmatory test as the Se of the three test serial reading was reduced significantly without adding a significant improvement of the Sp compared to the serial reading of the P-ELISA and AGID alone. However, the perceived cost of false positives versus false negatives will influence this decision. Estimates of the predictive values for the tests and combinations suggested that the P-ELISA is a good choice of screening, but confirmatory tests are needed to achieve acceptable levels of positive predictive values.

@article{berkvens_estimating_2006,
	Abstract = {Studies sometimes estimate the prevalence of a disease from the results of one or more diagnostic tests that are applied to individuals of unknown disease status. This approach invariably means that, in the absence of a gold standard and without external constraints, more parameters must be estimated than the data permit. Two assumptions are regularly made in the literature, namely that the test characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) are constant over populations and the tests are conditionally independent given the true disease status. These assumptions have been criticized recently as being unrealistic. Nevertheless, to estimate the prevalence, some restrictions on the parameter estimates need to be imposed. We consider 2 types of restrictions: deterministic and probabilistic restrictions, the latter arising in a Bayesian framework when expert knowledge is available. Furthermore, we consider 2 possible parameterizations allowing incorporation of these restrictions. The first is an extension of the approach of Gardner et al and Dendukuri and Joseph to more than 2 diagnostic tests and assuming conditional dependence. We argue that this system of equations is difficult to combine with expert opinions. The second approach, based on conditional probabilities, looks more promising, and we develop this approach in a Bayesian context. To evaluate the combination of data with the (deterministic and probabilistic) constraints, we apply the recently developed Deviance Information Criterion and effective number of parameters estimated (p(D)) together with an appropriate Bayesian P value. We illustrate our approach using data collected in a study on the prevalence of porcine cysticercosis with verification from external data.},

@article{caraguel_use_2012,
	Abstract = {In the absence of a reference standard, a latent class model (LCM) was used in this study to assess diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and specificity (DSp) of a recently developed reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV). The study included 4 populations of Atlantic salmon, and to ensure the identifiability of the LCM, four additional detection methods were used in parallel including real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), virus isolation (VI), indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), and a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI). While a conventional LCM assumes DSe and DSp to be constant across the populations, Nerette et al. (2008) previously reported concerns about non-constant DSp of RT-PCR, which detects viral RNA from both active and inactive viral particles. It was suspected that some ISAV recovered fish may carry residual RNA and may be more likely to test positive compared to naive fish. The various mixture distributions of the two sub-classes of non-infected fish would lead to a non-constant combined DSp estimate across populations. Within a Bayesian framework, the conventional two-class LCM was extended to three classes of infection stages (naive non-infected, recovered noninfected carrying RNA, and infected). The resulting analysis confirmed the existence of three classes of fish with substantially different test performances for ISAV. For infected fish, DSe of RT-PCRs and VI approximated 90\%, and antibody based assays were the least sensitive (DSe around 65\%). Regardless of the test, the DSp estimates on naive fish were all above 98\% with LFI being in average the most specific. Only RT-PCR and qRT-PCR tested positive with the additional class of recovered fish (DSp around 30\%). The true infectious status of this sub-class (i.e. viral RNA carriers) is debatable and requires further knowledge about ISAV infection dynamics at the fish level. Promising applications of multiple class estimates require adjustments of traditional test interpretation and further epidemiological knowledge of the infection dynamics at the population level.

	Abstract = {The productivity of larval habitats of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae for pupae (the stage preceding adult metamorphosis) is poorly known, yet adult emergence from habitats is the primary determinant of vector density. To assess it, we used absolute sampling methods in four studies involving daily sampling for 25 days in 6 habitat types in a village in western Kenya. Anopheles gambiae s.s. comprised 82.5\% of emergent adults and Anopheles arabiensis the remainder. Pupal production occurred from a subset of habitats, primarily soil burrow pits, and was discontinuous in time, even when larvae occupied all habitats continuously. Habitat stability was positively associated with pupal productivity. In a dry season, pupal productivity was distributed between burrow pits and pools in streambeds. Overall, these data support the notion that source reduction measures against recognizably productive habitats would be a useful component of an integrated management program for An. gambiae in villages.},

@article{thumbi_parasite_2014,
	Abstract = {In natural populations, individuals may be infected with multiple distinct pathogens at a time. These pathogens may act independently or interact with each other and the host through various mechanisms, with resultant varying outcomes on host health and survival. To study effects of pathogens and their interactions on host survival, we followed 548 zebu cattle during their first year of life, determining their infection and clinical status every 5 weeks. Using a combination of clinical signs observed before death, laboratory diagnostic test results, gross-lesions on post-mortem examination, histo-pathology results and survival analysis statistical techniques, cause-specific aetiology for each death case were determined, and effect of co-infections in observed mortality patterns. East Coast fever (ECF) caused by protozoan parasite Theileria parva and haemonchosis were the most important diseases associated with calf mortality, together accounting for over half (52\%) of all deaths due to infectious diseases. Co-infection with Trypanosoma species increased the hazard for ECF death by 6 times (1.4--25; 95\% CI). In addition, the hazard for ECF death was increased in the presence of Strongyle eggs, and this was burden dependent. An increase by 1000 Strongyle eggs per gram of faeces count was associated with a 1.5 times (1.4--1.6; 95\% CI) increase in the hazard for ECF mortality. Deaths due to haemonchosis were burden dependent, with a 70\% increase in hazard for death for every increase in strongyle eggs per gram count of 1000. These findings have important implications for disease control strategies, suggesting a need to consider co-infections in epidemiological studies as opposed to single-pathogen focus, and benefits of an integrated approach to helminths and East Coast fever disease control.},

@article{thumbi_mortality_2013,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Infectious livestock diseases remain a major threat to attaining food security and are a source of economic and livelihood losses for people dependent on livestock for their livelihood. Knowledge of the vital infectious diseases that account for the majority of deaths is crucial in determining disease control strategies and in the allocation of limited funds available for disease control. Here we have estimated the mortality rates in zebu cattle raised in a smallholder mixed farming system during their first year of life, identified the periods of increased risk of death and the risk factors for calf mortality, and through analysis of post-mortem data, determined the aetiologies of calf mortality in this population. A longitudinal cohort study of 548 zebu cattle was conducted between 2007 and 2010. Each calf was followed during its first year of life or until lost from the study. Calves were randomly selected from 20 sub-locations and recruited within a week of birth from different farms over a 45 km radius area centered on Busia in the Western part of Kenya. The data comprised of 481.1 calf years of observation. Clinical examinations, sample collection and analysis were carried out at 5 week intervals, from birth until one year old. Cox proportional hazard models with frailty terms were used for the statistical analysis of risk factors. A standardized post-mortem examination was conducted on all animals that died during the study and appropriate samples collected.RESULTS:The all-cause mortality rate was estimated at 16.1 (13.0-19.2; 95\% CI) per 100 calf years at risk. The Cox models identified high infection intensity with Theileria spp., the most lethal of which causes East Coast Fever disease, infection with Trypanosome spp., and helminth infections as measured by Strongyle spp. eggs per gram of faeces as the three important infections statistically associated with infectious disease mortality in these calves. Analysis of post-mortem data identified East Coast Fever as the main cause of death accounting for 40\% of all deaths, haemonchosis 12\% and heartwater disease 7\%.CONCLUSION:The findings demonstrate the impact of endemic parasitic diseases in indigenous animals expected to be well adapted against disease pressures. Additionally, agreement between results of Cox models using data from simple diagnostic procedures and results from post-mortem analysis underline the potential use such diagnostic data to reduce calf mortality. The control strategies for the identified infectious diseases have been discussed.},

Initially, groups of 10 first-season grazing (FSG) cattle were each year assigned to four parasite control strategies: (1) turn-out onto pasture that during the previous year was grazed by SSG cattle, followed by a mid-July move to aftermath, (2) supplementation with concentrate and roughage for 4 weeks after turn-out, (3) no treatment, or (4) anthelmintic treatment (injectable doramectin) every fourth week All animals were set stocked, except for those in group one. Next spring and following housing the cattle were turned out for their second grazing season onto approximately 25 ha communal pasturelands as a common mob. Weighing, faecal sampling and blood collection were performed at turn-out and then every 4 weeks for the 20-week grazing season. Faecal samples were also collected on day 10 after turnout for detection of coccidian oocysts. Antibodies to Dictyocaulus viviparus were analysed at the time of their second housing period, and when elevated levels were recorded, stored serum samples from seropositive animals were analysed retrospectively. Results showed early-season weight losses of up to 47 kg in the SSG cattle. However, faecal egg counts were generally low and there was no correlation between SSG performance and treatment history as FSG cattle. Still, cumulative egg counts were significantly higher in animals that had been treated with anthelmintic as FSG cattle but serum pepsinogen concentrations showed no significant differences and the output of Eimeria alabamensis oocysts seldom exceeded 10,000 oocysts per gram faeces. Antibodies to D. viviparus were observed from July 2004 and from June 2005 but not in 2003. In 2004 and 2005, 64\% and 83\% of the animals, respectively, were seropositive for D. viviparus. It is concluded that weight gain penalties resulting from different levels of parasite infections the first grazing season remained during the second grazing season in 2004 and 2005 but no differences in weight gain could be identified in SSG cattle that had experienced different parasite control measures during their first grazing season. This was under conditions where the level of pasture infectivity was low to moderate during the second grazing period. However. D. viviparus was demonstrated in SSG animals during the two last years of the study and was an important confounding factor. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{griffiths_analysis_2014,
	Abstract = {Simultaneous infection by multiple parasite species (viruses, bacteria, helminths, protozoa or fungi) is commonplace. Most reports show co-infected humans to have worse health than those with single infections. However, we have little understanding of how co-infecting parasites interact within human hosts. We used data from over 300 published studies to construct a network that offers the first broad indications of how groups of co-infecting parasites tend to interact. The network had three levels comprising parasites, the resources they consume and the immune responses they elicit, connected by potential, observed and experimentally proved links. Pairs of parasite species had most potential to interact indirectly through shared resources, rather than through immune responses or other parasites. In addition, the network comprised 10 tightly knit groups, eight of which were associated with particular body parts, and seven of which were dominated by parasite--resource links. Reported co-infection in humans is therefore structured by physical location within the body, with bottom-up, resource-mediated processes most often influencing how, where and which co-infecting parasites interact. The many indirect interactions show how treating an infection could affect other infections in co-infected patients, but the compartmentalized structure of the network will limit how far these indirect effects are likely to spread.},

Pregnancy was diagnosed in 168 buffalo-cows once by TRP and PAG-RIA test between days 31 and 55 after breeding. The sensitivity of TRP for detecting pregnant buffalo-cows was 37.5\% at days 31-35, increased to 93.8\% at days 46-50 and reached 100\% at days 51-55 (P {\textless} 0.01). All cases of false negative diagnoses (n = 10) had PAG concentration higher than the threshold (a parts per thousand yen1.8 ng/mL) for diagnosing pregnancy. The specificity of TRP for detecting non-pregnant buffalo cows ranged between 90.9\%, and 100\% between days 31 and 55. All cases of false positive diagnoses (n = 5) made by TRP had PAG concentrations lower than the threshold for diagnosing pregnancy. It could be concluded that TRP is an accurate method for diagnosing pregnant and non-pregnant buffalo cows from day 46 after breeding.},

	Abstract = {Epidemiological models and studies of disease ecology typically ignore the role of host condition and immunocompetence when trying to explain the distribution and dynamics of infections and their impact on host dynamics. Recent research, however, indicates that host susceptibility should be considered carefully if we are to understand the mechanism by which parasite dynamics influence host dynamics and vice versa. Studies in insects, fish, amphibians and rodents show that infection occurrence and intensity are more probable and more severe in individuals with an underlying poor condition. Moreover, infection itself results in further deterioration of the host and a 'vicious circle' is created. We argue that this potential synergy between host susceptibility and infection should be more widely acknowledged in disease ecology research.},

	Abstract = {In southern Punjab, Pakistan, Muzaffargarh District is known to have insecticide-resistant Anopheles and drug-resistant Plasmodium spp. In this part of the country, five anopheline mosquitoes, Anopheles stephensi Liston, Anopheles culicifacies Giles, Anopheles fluviatilis James, Anopheles superpictus Grassi, and Anopheles subpictus Grassi (Diptera: Culicidae) are known as malaria vectors. Among these, An. culicifacies is the primary and An. stephensi is the secondary malaria vector. Outbreaks of malaria usually occur after rainy episodes. We conducted field surveys to collect field strains of An. culicifacies and An. stephensi mosquitoes from different areas of Muzaffargarh District. We determined susceptibility and irritability levels of their adult stages to the discriminative dose of different insecticides. For this purpose, we used World Health Organization's established criteria for assessment. Mortality was calculated after 1 h exposure and for 24 h recovery period for various insecticides. An. stephensi was found to be significantly resistant to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT, an organochlorine), dieldrin (a chlorinated hydrocarbon), and malathion (organophosphorus), with lethal times (LT50) of 83.17, 52.48, and 37.53, respectively. However, the species was significantly sensitive to permethrin, deltamethrin (pyrethroids), and fenitrothion (organophosphate) with LT50 of 2.85, 2.34, and 13.18, respectively. Among these, permethrin showed more promising results against adult An. stephensi. When analyzed for irritancy, we found that among pyrethroids, permethrin was the most irritant insecticide for both An. stephensi and An. culicifacies. DDT and dieldrin showed least irritancy with 0.42 +/- 0.08 and 0.77 +/- 0.12 takeoffs per minute per adult, respectively, against An. stephensi. The mean number of takeoffs per minute per adult with permethrin showed significant irritancy for permethrin when compared with DDT. Based on this study, we conclude that the use of organochlorine (DDT) and chlorinated hydrocarbon (dieldrin) should not be reintroduced in Malaria Control Programme in Pakistan until there is enough evidence to do so at any stage in future, and the use of pyrethroids should continue, with preference to permethrin for better control of malaria by indoor residual spraying.},

	Abstract = {Pyrethroid pesticides are commonly used in tropical regions such as the Caribbean as household insecticides, pet sprays, and where malaria is endemic, impregnated into mosquito-repellent nets. Of particular concern is exposure during pregnancy, as these compounds have the potential to cross the placental barrier and interfere with fetal development, as was shown in limited animal studies. The objective of this study was to evaluate exposure to pyrethroids to pregnant women residing in 10 English-speaking Caribbean countries. Pyrethroid exposures were determined by analyzing five pyrethroid metabolites in urine samples from 295 pregnant women: cis-DBCA, cis-DCCA, trans-DCCA, 3-PBA, and 4-F-3-PBA. Pyrethroid metabolite concentrations in Caribbean pregnant women were generally higher in the 10 Caribbean countries than levels reported for Canadian and U.S. women. In Antigua \& Barbuda and Jamaica participants the geometric mean concentrations of cis-DBCA was significantly higher than in the other nine countries together (p {\textless} 0.0001 and {\textless} 0.0012 respectively). For cis- and trans-DCCA, only Antigua \& Barbuda women differed significantly from participants of the other nine Caribbean countries (p {\textless} 0.0001). Urinary 4-F-3-PBA and 3-PBA levels were significantly higher in Antigua \& Barbuda (p {\textless} 0.0028 and p {\textless} 0.0001 respectively) as well as in Grenada (p {\textless} 0.0001 and p {\textless} 0.007 respectively). These results indicate extensive use of pyrethroid compounds such as permethrin and cypermethrin in Caribbean households. In Antigua \& Barbuda, the data reveals a greater use of deltamethrin. This study underscores the need for Caribbean public health authorities to encourage their populations, and in particular pregnant women, to utilize this class of pesticides more judiciously given the potentially adverse effects of exposure on fetuses and infants.

	Abstract = {Objectives To compare the effectiveness on Aedes aegypti (Linneo) (Diptera: Culicidae) of a larvicide-adulticide ULV formulation applied by a thermal or a cold fogger using different solvents. Methods We applied, in field conditions, a ULV formulation containing pyriproxyfen and permethrin, using a thermal and a cold fogger and water or diesel as solvent. We determined the effectiveness of these applications on Ae. aegypti adults and larvae by different bioassays and measuring Breteau, house and adult indices. Results When water was used as solvent, the treatments applied with the cold or the thermal foggers were equally effective on adult mortality (close to 90\%) and adult emergence inhibition (\% EI) (close to 70\%). When the thermal fogger was used with water as solvent, the adult mortality outside the houses (85\%) was higher, but not significantly different, than with diesel (65\%). The contrary happens inside (22\%vs. 58\%), while there were no differences in \%EI. Adult and larval indices behaved similarly in all areas, with a slight tendency for the treatments applied using water as solvent to be more effective. Conclusions Water-based formulations are equally or more effective than the one applied with diesel as solvent. The use of water as solvent will not only improve the effectiveness of this formulation but also reduce the environmental impact and costs of spraying compared to the use of diesel.},

Flight tracks of host-seeking female Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles albimanus, and Aedes aegypti in a wind tunnel were video-recorded to compare activation of host-seeking and patterns of flight orientation to host odors. During host-seeking flights, all three mosquito species differed significantly in flight duration, velocity, turn angle, and angular velocity. Mosquitoes were then exposed to sublethal levels (LD25) of pyrethroid insecticides to evaluate the effects of the neurotoxicants 24 hours post-exposure. Significant reductions in time of activation to flight and flight direction were observed in mosquitoes exposed to deltamethrin and permethrin. Additionally, pesticide-treated Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes flew significantly slower, spent more time in flight, and turned more frequently than untreated controls.},

	Abstract = {Treating perimeters with residual insecticides for protection from mosquito vectors has shown promise. These barrier treatments are typically evaluated in temperate or tropical areas using abundant vegetation as a substrate. However, there is an emerging interest to develop this technology to protect deployed US troops in extreme desert environments with sparse vegetation, We used a remote desert area in the Coachella Valley, California, to 1) evaluate bifenthrin barrier treatments on native xeric vegetation and 2) compare treatments applied with electrostatic and conventional spray technologies. Through a combination of laboratory bioassays on treated and control vegetation sampled at specific intervals over 63 days, synchronized with field surveillance of mosquitoes, we measured the temporal pattern of bioactivity of bifenthrin barriers under natural hot, dry, and dusty desert conditions. Regardless of spray technology, mosquito catch in treated plots was about 80\% lower than the catch in control plots I day after treatment. This reduction in mosquito numbers in treated plots declined each week after treatment but remained at about 40\% lower than control plots after 28 days. Field data were corroborated by results from bioassays that showed significantly higher mosquito mortality on treated vegetation over controls out to 28 days postspray. We concluded that barrier treatments in desert environments, when implemented as part of a suite of integrated control measures, may offer a significant level of protection from mosquitoes for deployed troops. Given the comparable performance of the tested spray technologies, we discuss considerations for choosing a barrier treatment sprayer for military scenarios.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Public health agencies may apply aerosolized synergized pyrethrin over wetlands repeatedly to control mosquitoes. This concerns wildlife managers because studies have shown the accumulation of pyrethroids, which are chemically similar to pyrethrin, in sediments in amounts that can be toxic to invertebrates. The authors tested whether repeated applications of synergized pyrethrin over wetlands caused mortality of two aquatic invertebrates: the zooplankton Daphnia magna Straus and a mayfly, Callibaetis californicus Banks. Fifteen wetland mesocosms were either exposed to repeated pyrethrin sprays or were protected by lids. Invertebrates in screened cages were placed in mesocosms before the fifth and eleventh spray, and directly into wetlands before spray 11. Six mesocosms were exposed to spray deposition. Caged adult mosquitoes were used to verify that sprays drifted over mesocosms. Sediments were analyzed for insecticide residues. RESULTS: There were no detectable effects of synergized pyrethrin on 36 h survival of Daphnia or mayflies, but most exposed adult mosquitoes died. Some exposed sediments yielded pyrethrin ({\textless}= 34.5 ng g(-1)); most showed piperonyl butoxide (PBO) ({\textless}= 14.9 ng g(-1)). CONCLUSIONS: Deposition of aerosolized 25\% pyrethrin + 5\% PBO may contaminate wetlands, but its application at rates used for mosquito control did not produce detectable effects on indicator species.

	Abstract = {Mosquito management plans have been implemented in the United States and globally to manage mosquito vectors of West Nile virus and many other diseases. However, there is public concern about ecological risks from using insecticides to manage mosquitoes. Two studies were conducted during the late summers of 2004 through 2006 at Benton Lake National Wildlife Refuge near Great Falls, MT. The first experiment was conducted in 2004 and 2005 to assess acute impacts of mosquito adulticides (permethrin and d-phenothrin) and larvicides (Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis and methoprene) on nontarget aquatic and terrestrial arthropods after a single application. The second experiment was conducted in 2005 and 2006 to assess longer-term impacts of permethrin on nontarget terrestrial arthropods after multiple repeated applications. For aquatic samples, in the first study, no overall treatment effects were observed despite a potentially deleterious effect on amphipods on sample date 1 in 2004. During the same study, 1 of 54 responses had a significant overall treatment effect for sticky-card samples. Many of the responses for sticky-card samples suggested significant time effects and time X treatment effects. Three response variables were associated with fewer individuals present in the insecticide-treated plots in a multivariate analysis. For the multiple-spray study conducted in 2005 and 2006, 6 of the response variables collected via sticky cards exhibited significant overall treatment effects, but none was associated with fewer individuals in the insecticide-treated plots. None of the responses collected using sweep-net sampling suggested overall treatment effects. Time and time X treatment effects were prevalent in 2005, but no discernable pattern was evident. In general, nearly all of the responses evaluated for either study indicated few, if any, deleterious effects from insecticide application.},

	Abstract = {One of the most effective ways of managing adult mosquitoes that vector human and animals diseases is the use of ultralow-volume insecticides. Because of concerns about the safety of the insecticides used for the management of adult mosquitoes, we conducted an environmental fate and efficacy study in Princeton and Colusa (both CA, USA) after aerial applications of pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide (PBO). One hour before application, PBO concentrations in water were 0.008 and 0.2175 mu g/L for Princeton and Colusa, respectively. One hour after the spray event in Princeton, the average PBO concentrations were 0.0125 mu g/cm(2) on ground-deposition pads and 0.1723 mu g/L in water samples, with concentrations decreasing significantly over time. One hour after the spray event in Colusa, the average PBO concentrations were 0.0199 mu g/cm(2) on deposition pads and 1.274 mu g/L in water samples, with concentrations decreasing significantly over time. A significant time and location effect for both deposition pads and water samples in Princeton and Colusa was observed (p {\textless} 0.001 and p = 0.014, respectively). Pyrethrins were not detected in nearly all ground and water samples. One hour after application, mortality of Culex tarsalis and Culex pipiens in sentinel cages was significantly higher than at the control site for both locations (p {\textless} 0.001). Risk quotients for aquatic surrogate species in Princeton and Colusa were 0.002 or less at 1 h after application, which did not exceed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency risk quotient level of concern for endangered aquatic organisms of 0.05. Our results suggest that the amounts of pyrethrins and PBO deposited on the ground and in water after aerial ULV insecticide applications are lower than those estimated by previous exposure and risk assessments.},

The result showed that an average of 55.53\% and 70.32\% permethrin in Aqua-Reslin were decomposed in the ULV spray truck tanks and in the mixers/pumps, respectively, during the 4-month mosquito off-season. The degradation may directly result in economic loss. Also, the mosquito control efficacy may be compromised if the concentrations are inappropriate. The permethrin analytical method, economic cost, and degradation-prevention methods are discussed in this article.},

@article{lothrop_evaluation_2007,
	Abstract = {Six experimental ground ultra-low volume (ULV) applications of Pyrenoneg((R)) 25-5 (0.0025 lb/acre) and Aqua-Resling((R)) (0.007 lb/acre) were made by truck-mounted Pro-Mist((R)) or London Fog((R)) equipment over 1-mi(2) study areas in rural and residential environments of the Coachella Valley, Riverside County, California. Efficacy of replicate applications was evaluated by measuring mortality among caged sentinel mosquitoes, by evaluating changes in host-seeking abundance at replicated dry ice-baited traps positioned along intersecting east-west and north-south transects, and by differential recapture patterns of marked females released near traps in the sprayed central core and unsprayed control areas. Sentinel mortality agreed well with estimates of droplet density measured by "slide spinners" and was affected by 1) distance of cages from the truck route; 2) landscape features, such as tree lines that created wind shadows; 3) irregular landscape that disrupted the particle cloud; 4) low wind speed that failed to carry the droplet cloud through the environment; and 5) failure of the droplets to penetrate dead airspace within stands of vegetation. Despite variable sentinel mortality, Culex tarsalis relative abundance in rural landscapes within and around our study areas always declined after ULV applications. Concurrent decreases in abundance at traps within sprayed and adjoining unsprayed areas confounded our estimates of percentage of control using Mulla's formula, which compares abundance in sprayed and unsprayed areas pre- and postspray. ULV applications significantly affected recapture patterns, in that recapture rates within the spray zone usually were significantly less than in the unsprayed zone. Collectively, our data indicated that ground ULV applications measurably reduced Cx. tarsalis abundance in rural areas of the Coachella Valley but that further evaluations may be necessary to validate efficacy on Culex quinquefasciatus populations in residential communities.},

	Abstract = {A study comparing the effectiveness of barrier treatment of military tents with bifenthrin and permethrin in preventing entry of mosquitoes was conducted at Wide Bay Training Area, Queensland, Australia. Five military tents were erected at a site in bushland at Mosquito Creek, about 2 kin from the coast. Two tents were sprayed with bifenthrin (Bistar(TM) 80SC, 0.1\% mix, 12.5 ml/liter) and 2 with permethrin (Perigen((R)) 500, 1.2\%, 24 ml/liter). One was left untreated and served as a control. Carbon dioxide-baited traps were placed inside each tent 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 wk after treatment, and a single trap was placed in forest 50 in from the tents. The predominant mosquito species collected was Aedes vigilax (78\% of collection). Compared to the untreated control, protection against mosquitoes entering treated tents was initially 78.6\% for bifenthrin-treated tents and 84.3\% for permethrin. At 4 wk, protection was 68.6\% for bifenthrin and 50.7\% for permethrin. After 6 wk, less than 34\% protection was provided by either insecticide. There was no significant difference between the protection provided by either insecticide treatment. The study showed that barrier tent treatments provide a reasonable increase in preventing the entry of mosquitoes for at least 4 wk.},

@article{trout_efficacy_2007,
	Abstract = {Increased threat of mosquito-borne disease coupled with decreased tolerance of nuisance mosquitoes has opened a market for pest management professionals to offer mosquito control services for homeowners. A pest management professional applied bifenthrin (0.08\%) and lambdacyhalothrin (0.1\%) at their maximum label concentrations as barrier treatments. We tested treatments residual efficacy in reducing adult mosquito populations and compared these chemicals against a water control at 24 residential properties (eight replications by three treatments). Mosquito populations were measured on each property by using five methods: CO2-baited Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light traps (without a light), human landing rates, CDC gravid traps, ovitraps, and sweep nets. Populations were monitored weekly for 2 wk before treatment and 8 wk posttreatment. Additionally, to confirm residual efficacy of each insecticide, a randomly treated leaf underwent a no-choice bioassay with laboratory-reared Aedes albopictus (Skuse). Trap collections were dominantly Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens L. Both insecticidal treatments significantly reduced Aedes spp. lambda-Cyhalothrin- and bifenthrin-treated sites had 89.5 and 85.1\% fewer Ae. albopictus bites than the untreated control, respectively. Ae. albopictus bioassay results showed significant residual efficacy for both insecticides up to 6 wk posttreatment. There were no significant differences between properties treated with the two insecticides. In contrast, Culex spp. were not reduced by either insecticidal treatment. Our study indicated that barrier sprays applied to low-lying vegetation do not properly target adult daytime resting sites for Culex mosquitoes but that they can reduce Aedes mosquitoes. Perhaps by treating upper tree canopies Culex spp. abundance may be reduced.},

@article{oberhauser_growth_2006,
	Abstract = {We assessed the toxicity of permethrin residues from barrier treatments for mosquito control on monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus L.) larvae and adults. The motivation for this study was an absence of work on the effects of this commonly used insecticide on nontarget herbivorous insects and the fact that monarchs' host plant, milkweed (Asclepias spp.), is often found in treated areas. In one experiment, larvae fed leaves from naturally growing milkweeds in operationally treated areas were much less likely to survive than control larvae, even when treated leaves were collected up to 21 d after spraying. In a second experiment, larvae fed leaves from potted milkweeds sprayed with 0.5 and 0.1\% dilutions of the operational dose had lower survival and longer development times than control larvae. In a third experiment, ovipositing females did not discriminate against permethrin-treated plants. Female survival in 0.66-m(3) cages with plants sprayed I d earlier was very low, whereas survival was greater if plants were assayed 8 or 15 d later. In a fourth experiment, neither frequent overhead watering (versus watering from below) nor outdoor sunlight (versus in a glasshouse) over a 14-d period lessened the toxicity of sprayed plants to larvae. These findings indicate that monarch larvae and adults are likely to be killed if exposed to residues of permethrin after barrier treatments for mosquito control. Extent of mortality in a field population of monarch butterflies will depend, among other things, on the proportion of host plants that are treated in a given area.},

	Abstract = {Species traits have been frequently used in ecological studies in an attempt to develop a general ecological framework linking biological communities to habitat pressures. The trait approach offers a mechanistic alternative to traditional taxonomy-based descriptors. This review focuses on research employing traits as biomonitoring tools for freshwater ecosystems, although the lessons learned have wider application in the assessment of other ecosystem types. 2. We review the support from ecological theory to employ species traits for biomonitoring purposes (e.g. the habitat templet concept, landscape filtering hypothesis), and the subsequent studies that test the hypotheses arising from these theories, and apply this knowledge under real freshwater biomonitoring scenarios. We also include studies that deal with more specific issues such as trait trade-offs and trait syndromes. 3. We highlight the functional trait approach as one of the most promising tools emerging for biomonitoring freshwater ecosystems. Several technical issues are addressed and solutions are proposed. We discuss the need for: a broader unified trait biomonitoring tool; a more accurate understanding of the natural variation of community patterns of trait expression; approaches to diminish the effects of trait trade-offs and trait syndromes; additional life history and ecological requirement studies; and the detection of specific impacts under multiple stressor scenarios. 4. Synthesis and applications. This review provides biologists with the conceptual underpinning for the use of species traits as community descriptors and for freshwater biomonitoring and management. We expect that the functional trait approach will ultimately improve communication to managers and legislators of the importance of protecting freshwater ecosystem functions.},

	Abstract = {There is considerable debate about whether community ecology will ever produce general principles. We suggest here that this can be achieved but that community ecology has lost its way by focusing on pairwise species interactions independent of the environment. We assert that community ecology should return to an emphasis on four themes that are tied together by a two-step process: how the fundamental niche is governed by functional traits within the context of abiotic environmental gradients; and how the interaction between traits and fundamental niches maps onto the realized niche in the context of a biotic interaction milieu. We suggest this approach can create a more quantitative and predictive science that can more readily address issues of global change.},

	Abstract = {1. Relating species traits to habitat characteristics can provide important insights into the structure and functioning of stream communities. However, trade-offs among species traits make it difficult to predict accurately the functional diversity of freshwater communities. Many authors have pointed to the value of working with groups of organisms as similar as possible in terms of relationships among traits and have called for definition of groups of organisms with similar suites of attributes. 2. We used multivariate analyses to examine separately the relationships among 11 biological traits and among 11 ecological traits of 472 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa (mainly general. The main objective was to demonstrate (1) potential trade-offs among traits; (2) the importance of the different traits to separate systematic units or functional groupings; and (3) uniform functional groups of taxa that should allow a more effective use of macroinvertebrate biological and ecological traits. 3. We defined eight groups and 15 subgroups according to a biological trait ordination which highlighted size (large to small), reproductive traits (K to r strategists), food (animal to plant material) and feeding habits (predator to scraper and/or deposit feeder) as 'significant' factors determining the ordination of taxa. This ordination partly preserved phylogenetic relationships among groups. 4. Seven ecological groups and 13 ecological subgroups included organisms with combinations of traits which should be successively more adequate in habitats from the main channel to temporary waters, and from the crenon to the potamic sections of rivers, and to systems situated outside the river floodplain. These gradients corresponded to a gradual shift from (1) rheophilic organisms that lived in the main channel of cold oligotrophic mountain streams to (2) animals that preferred eutrophic habitats of still or temporary waters in lowlands. The groups with similar ecological traits had a more diverse systematic structure than those with similar biological traits. 5. Monitoring and assessment tools for the management of water resources are generally more effective if they are based on a clear understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the presence or absence of species groups in the environment. We believe that groups with similar relationships among their species traits may be useful, in developing tools that measure the functional diversity of communities.},

@article{tomanova_patterns_2007,
	Abstract = {Previously tested in temperate ecoregions, the River Habitat Templet concept provides a framework for relating the characteristics of species (i.e. traits indicating species ecological functions) to habitat attributes. As species traits are comparable among most faunal groups, they can be used to examine community patterns in ecological functions at a large spatial scale, even across areas that differ in the taxonomic composition of their communities. If local physical attributes produce similar trait patterns on a global scale, the River Habitat Templet can serve as a general predictive too] of community characteristics regardless of geographical zones. We studied eight biological traits in 82 neotropical taxa: i) food, ii) feeding habits, iii) respiration, iv) maximum body size, v) body flexibility, vi) body form, vii) specific adaptation to flow constraints and viii) mobility and attachment to substratum. A multivariate approach was used to examine taxonomic and functional (trait) differences in macroinvertebrate assemblages among study sites. Proportions of trait modalities were examined in relation to Froude number, substratum roughness and benthic organic matter availability at mesohabitat scale. Even if communities differed taxonomically, they were functionally similar. Thirty of 46 trait modalities of neotropical aquatic taxa were significantly related to at least one selected environmental attribute. The results clearly support the habitat templet as a major driver of macro invertebrate community structure in neotropical running waters. But the observed 'trait/ habitat' relationships did not sufficiently match those from temperate areas for us to confirm the existence of general rules organizing functional trait structure among benthic invertebrate communities that would be applicable in different climatic regions.},

@article{townsend_quantifying_1997,
	Abstract = {Appropriate tests of disturbance theory require that disturbance is defined and measured in an organism-related sense. We quantified 7 measures of disturbance, 3 dealing with the pattern of disturbance of the stream bed (assessed using painted tracer particles), 3 dealing with aspects of discharge variation and 1 being a subjective composite measure of stream channel stability (Pfankuch's index). Hypotheses relating to invertebrate taxon richness (maximal at intermediate levels of disturbance) and the representation of particular insect species traits (assemblages in more disturbed sites contain higher percentages of individuals possessing high adult mobility and streamlined-flattened larval morphology) were both supported when disturbance was measured in terms of bed movement but generally not when measured in terms of discharge variation. When disturbance was estimated by Pfankuch's index, species trait predictions were supported but the taxon richness prediction was not. A co-inertia analysis, searching for a co-structure between our environmental and faunistic data sets, allowed us to distinguish taxa that apparently are resistant to bed movement from tara that appear to be resistant to flow variations; this more detailed analysis indicates that the most appropriate measure of disturbance may vary even among quite closely related taxa. The construction of a comprehensive theory of disturbance in streams requires that disturbance is quantified in a way that allows both multi-site and multi-study comparisons. The painted-particle approach, described here, has the potential to permit such standarized comparative studies.},

	Abstract = {Abiotic and biotic processes operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales to shape many ecological processes, including species distributions and demography. Current debate about the relative roles of niche-based and stochastic processes in shaping species distributions and community composition reflects, in part, the challenge of understanding how these processes interact across scales. Traditional statistical models that ignore autocorrelation and spatial hierarchies can result in misidentification of important ecological covariates. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a hierarchical modeling framework for testing hypotheses about the importance of abiotic factors at different spatial scales and local spatial autocorrelation for shaping species distributions and abundances. For the two orchid species studied, understory light availability and soil moisture helped to explain patterns of presence and abundance at a microsite scale ({\textless} 4 m(2)), while soil organic content was important at a population scale ({\textless} 400 m(2)). The inclusion of spatial autocorrelation is shown to alter the magnitude and certainty of estimated relationships between abundance and abiotic variables, and we suggest that such analysis be used more often to explore the relationships between species life histories and distributions. The hierarchical modeling framework is shown to have great potential for elucidating ecological relationships involving abiotic and biotic processes simultaneously at multiple scales.},

	Abstract = {1. A large proportion of the world's land surface is extensively managed for livestock production. In areas where livestock systems are becoming more intensive, a major challenge is to predict those plant species likely to decline, persist or increase as a result of agricultural intensification. 2. Most analyses develop inferences for frequent or abundant species, or rely on intensive studies of single species. A promising approach is to identify plant traits related to disturbance to enable inference to be made about changes in plant community composition. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyse the response to agricultural intensification of 494 plant species of pastures and woodlands in southern Australia, and to identify how simple species' traits (life form, growth form and species origin) influence those responses. 3. The probability of occurrence of most species declined along the two intensification gradients, grazing intensity and soil phosphorous concentration, although the occurrence of a greater proportion of species was negatively correlated with soil phosphorous. Responses could be broadly predicted from both plant origin and plant traits, in particular growth form. 4. Native perennial geophytes, ferns and shrubs were most negatively affected by both gradients, while exotic annual grasses and forbs were more tolerant. Along the phosphorous gradient, 24 of the 30 most negatively affected plant species were native geophytes. Mean within-group responses masked considerable within- and between-species variation, particularly for the exotic species group which included species that responded both negatively and positively to intensification. 5. Synthesis and applications. The hierarchical model described here provides a powerful method for estimating individual plant responses and identifying how species' traits influence those responses. Plant species native to southern Australia are sensitive to grazing and phosphorous apparently due to a shared evolutionary history of low grazing intensity and low phosphorous soils. Invading exotic plants have faced strongly contrasting ecological filters, leading to a greater diversity of responses. Where grazing systems have been most intense, a small suite of exotics dominate. Maintaining native and functional plant diversity will necessitate limits being placed on intensive livestock management systems.},

This report describes a pathological, immunohistochemical and bacteriological study of 42 cows and their progeny (aborted fetuses, weak premature calves, and healthy full-term calves) infected at 6--7 months of gestation by conjunctival inoculation with Brucella abortus. Samples were collected at necropsy within 48 h of abortion or parturition. The most significant lesions were necrotizing and suppurative placentitis and lymphohistiocytic mastitis in cows, and fibrinous pleuritis, fibrinous pericarditis and bronchopneumonia in aborted fetuses. B. abortus was isolated more frequently from milk samples than from mammary tissues, and milk samples from cows with mastitis were often infected. Organisms were often demonstrated immunohistochemically and by culture in tissues showing moderate to severe histological changes.},

	Abstract = {We used more than 10 years of data on buffalo herds in a Geographic Information System (GIS) of Klaserie Private Nature Reserve (KPNR) to examine ranging behavior and habitat selection at multiple temporal and geographic scales. We compared 3 methods of empirical home range estimation: minimum convex polygons (MCP); a fixed-kemel method, and a new local nearest-neighbor convex-hull construction method (LoCoH). For 3 herds over 5 years (1995-2000), the southern herd (SH) had the largest range, the focal study herd (FH) had the intermediate range, and the northern herd (NH) had the smallest range. The LoCoH method best-described the ranges because it accommodated user knowledge of known physical barriers, such as fences, whereas the MCP and kernel methods overestimated ranges. Short-term ranges of the FH over 9 years reveal that buffalo travel farther and range wider in the dry season than the wet. Habitat selection analyses on broad vegetation categories showed preference for Acacia shrub veld and Combretum-dominated woodlands. We found no significant selection of habitat at a fine geographic and temporal interval using the remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), but the index was correlated to ranging behavior at a larger geographic scale. We found that buffalo selected areas within 1 km of water sources, and an isopleth analysis using the new LoCoH method showed preference for riverine areas in both seasons. This suggests that buffalo preferentially select for areas near water, but they may range farther in the dry season for higher-quality food. As KPNR has a higher density of water than the neighboring Kruger National Park (KNP), this study provides a comparison of buffalo response to water availability in a smaller reserve and important information to managing the buffalo population as part of the larger Greater Kruger Management Area (GKMA).},

By comparing the result from models with different levels of detail in the description of animal movement, we studied how factors influence the final epidemic size as well as the dynamic behaviour of an outbreak. We investigated the effect of contact heterogeneity of pig herds in Sweden due to herd size, between-herd distance and production type. Our comparative study suggests that the production-type structure is the most influential factor. Hence, our results imply that production type is the most important factor to obtain valid data for and include when modelling and analysing this system. The study also revealed that all included factors reduce the final epidemic size and also have yet more diverse effects on initial rate of disease spread. This implies that a large set of factors ought to be included to assess relevant predictions when modelling disease spread between herds. Furthermore, our results show that a more detailed model changes predictions regarding the variability in the outbreak dynamics and conclude that this is an important factor to consider in risk assessment.},

@article{cross_wildlife_2012,
	Abstract = {Recent technological advances, such as proximity loggers, allow researchers to collect complete interaction histories, day and night, among sampled individuals over several months to years. Social network analyses are an obvious approach to analyzing interaction data because of their flexibility for fitting many different social structures as well as the ability to assess both direct contacts and indirect associations via intermediaries. For many network properties, however, it is not clear whether estimates based upon a sample of the network are reflective of the entire network. In wildlife applications, networks may be poorly sampled and boundary effects will be common. We present an alternative approach that utilizes a hierarchical modeling framework to assess the individual, dyadic, and environmental factors contributing to variation in the interaction rates and allows us to estimate the underlying process variation in each. In a disease control context, this approach will allow managers to focus efforts on those types of individuals and environments that contribute the most toward super-spreading events. We account for the sampling distribution of proximity loggers and the non-independence of contacts among groups by only using contact data within a group during days when the group membership of proximity loggers was known. This allows us to separate the two mechanisms responsible for a pair not contacting one another: they were not in the same group or they were in the same group but did not come within the specified contact distance. We illustrate our approach with an example dataset of female elk from northwestern Wyoming and conclude with a number of important future research directions.},

	Abstract = {Many endangered wildlife populations are vulnerable to infectious diseases for which vaccines exist; yet, pragmatic considerations often preclude large-scale vaccination efforts. These barriers could be reduced by focusing on individuals with the highest contact rates. However, the question then becomes whether targeted vaccination is sufficient to prevent large outbreaks. To evaluate the efficacy of targeted wildlife vaccinations, we simulate pathogen transmission and control on monthly association networks informed by behavioural data from a wild chimpanzee community (Kanyawara N = 37, Kibale National Park, Uganda). Despite considerable variation across monthly networks, our simulations indicate that targeting the most connected individuals can prevent large outbreaks with up to 35\% fewer vaccines than random vaccination. Transmission heterogeneities might be attributed to biological differences among individuals (e. g. sex, age, dominance and family size). Thus, we also evaluate the effectiveness of a trait-based vaccination strategy, as trait data are often easier to collect than interaction data. Our simulations indicate that a trait-based strategy can prevent large outbreaks with up to 18\% fewer vaccines than random vaccination, demonstrating that individual traits can serve as effective estimates of connectivity. Overall, these results suggest that fine-scale behavioural data can help optimize pathogen control efforts for endangered wildlife.},

@article{vanderwaal_linking_2014-1,
	Abstract = {Although network analysis has drawn considerable attention as a promising tool for disease ecology, empirical research has been hindered by limitations in detecting the occurrence of pathogen transmission (who transmitted to whom) within social networks. Using a novel approach, we utilize the genetics of a diverse microbe, Escherichia coli, to infer where direct or indirect transmission has occurred and use these data to construct transmission networks for a wild giraffe population (Giraffe camelopardalis). Individuals were considered to be a part of the same transmission chain and were interlinked in the transmission network if they shared genetic subtypes of E.coli. By using microbial genetics to quantify who transmits to whom independently from the behavioural data on who is in contact with whom, we were able to directly investigate how the structure of contact networks influences the structure of the transmission network. To distinguish between the effects of social and environmental contact on transmission dynamics, the transmission network was compared with two separate contact networks defined from the behavioural data: a social network based on association patterns, and a spatial network based on patterns of home-range overlap among individuals. We found that links in the transmission network were more likely to occur between individuals that were strongly linked in the social network. Furthermore, individuals that had more numerous connections or that occupied 'bottleneck' positions in the social network tended to occupy similar positions in the transmission network. No similar correlations were observed between the spatial and transmission networks. This indicates that an individual's social network position is predictive of transmission network position, which has implications for identifying individuals that function as super-spreaders or transmission bottlenecks in the population. These results emphasize the importance of association patterns in understanding transmission dynamics, even for environmentally transmitted microbes like E.coli. This study is the first to use microbial genetics to construct and analyse transmission networks in a wildlife population and highlights the potential utility of an approach integrating microbial genetics with network analysis.},

Using GPS loggers we identified the refuge sites used by each lizard on each day. We estimated infectious time windows for ticks that detached from a lizard in a refuge.

Previous research has shown that A. limbatum molts earlier and survives longer than B. hydrosauri. We developed two transmission network models based on these differences in infective time windows for the two tick species. Directed edges were generated in the network if one lizard used a refuge that had previously been used by another lizard within the infectious time window. We used those models to generate values of network node in-strength for each lizard, a measure of how strongly connected an individual is to other lizards in the transmission network, and a prediction of infection risk for each host. The consistent correlations over time between B. hydrosauri infection intensity and network derived infection risk suggest that network models can be robust to environmental variation among years.

The consistent correlations over time between B. hydrosauri infection intensity and network derived infection risk suggest that network models can be robust to environmental variation among years. However, the contrasting lack of consistent correlation in A. limbatum suggests that the utility of the same network models may depend on the specific biology of a parasite species.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
Social network analysis has recently emerged as a popular tool for understanding disease transmission in host populations. Although social networks have most extensively been applied to modelling the transmission of diseases through human populations, more recently the method has been applied to wildlife populations. The majority of examples from wildlife involve modelling the transmission of contagious microbes (mainly viruses and bacteria), normally in context of understanding wildlife disease epidemics. However, a growing number of studies have used networks to explore the ecology of parasite transmission in wildlife populations for a range of endemic parasites representing a diversity of life cycles and transmission methods. This review addresses the application of network models in representing the transmission of parasites with more complex life cycles, and illustrates the way in which this approach can be used to answer ecological questions about the transmission of parasites in wildlife populations.},

	Abstract = {Movement of animals from one farm to another is a potential risk and can lead to the spreading of livestock diseases. Therefore, in order to implement effective control measures, it is important to understand the movement network in a given area. Using the SANITEL data from 2005 to 2009, around 2 million cattle movements in Belgium were traced. Exploratory analysis revealed different spatial structures for the movement of different cattle types: fattening calves are mostly moved to the Antwerp region, adult cattle are moved to different parts in Belgium. Based on these differences, movement of cattle would more likely cause a spread of disease to a larger number of areas in Belgium as compared to the fattening calves. A closer inspection of the spatial and temporal patterns of cattle movement using a weighted negative binomial model, revealed a significant short-distance movement of bovine which could be an important factor contributing to the local spreading of a disease. The model however revealed hot spot areas of movement in Belgium; four areas in the Walloon region (Luxembourg, Hainaut, Namur and Liege) were found as hot spot areas while East and West Flanders are important "receivers" of movement. This implies that an introduction of a disease to these Walloon regions could result in a spread toward the East and West Flanders regions, as what happened in the case of Bluetongue BTV-8 outbreak in 2006. The temporal component in the model also revealed a linear trend and short- and long-term seasonality in the cattle movement with a peak around spring and autumn. The result of this explorative analysis enabled the identification of "hot spots" in time and space which is important in enhancing any existing monitoring and surveillance system.

	Abstract = {Globalization has increased the potential for the introduction and spread of novel pathogens over large spatial scales necessitating continental-scale disease models to guide emergency preparedness. Livestock disease spread models, such as those for the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in the United Kingdom, represent some of the best case studies of large-scale disease spread. However, generalization of these models to explore disease outcomes in other systems, such as the United States's cattle industry, has been hampered by differences in system size and complexity and the absence of suitable livestock movement data. Here, a unique database of US cattle shipments allows estimation of synthetic movement networks that inform a near-continental scale disease model of a potential FMD-like (i.e., rapidly spreading) epidemic in US cattle. The largest epidemics may affect over one-third of the US and 120,000 cattle premises, but cattle movement restrictions from infected counties, as opposed to national movement moratoriums, are found to effectively contain outbreaks. Slow detection or weak compliance may necessitate more severe state-level bans for similar control. Such results highlight the role of large-scale disease models in emergency preparedness, particularly for systems lacking comprehensive movement and outbreak data, and the need to rapidly implement multi-scale contingency plans during a potential US outbreak.},

	Abstract = {Networks are rarely completely observed and prediction of unobserved edges is an important problem, especially in disease spread modeling where networks are used to represent the pattern of contacts. We focus on a partially observed cattle movement network in the U.S. and present a method for scaling up to a full network based on Bayesian inference, with the aim of informing epidemic disease spread models in the United States. The observed network is a 10\% state stratified sample of Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection that are required for interstate movement; describing approximately 20,000 movements from 47 of the contiguous states, with origins and destinations aggregated at the county level. We address how to scale up the 10\% sample and predict unobserved intrastate movements based on observed movement distances. Edge prediction based on a distance kernel is not straightforward because the probability of movement does not always decline monotonically with distance due to underlying industry infrastructure. Hence, we propose a spatially explicit model where the probability of movement depends on distance, number of premises per county and historical imports of animals. Our model performs well in recapturing overall metrics of the observed network at the node level (U.S. counties), including degree centrality and betweenness; and performs better compared to randomized networks. Kernel generated movement networks also recapture observed global network metrics, including network size, transitivity, reciprocity, and assortativity better than randomized networks. In addition, predicted movements are similar to observed when aggregated at the state level (a broader geographic level relevant for policy) and are concentrated around states where key infrastructures, such as feedlots, are common. We conclude that the method generally performs well in predicting both coarse geographical patterns and network structure and is a promising method to generate full networks that incorporate the uncertainty of sampled and unobserved contacts.},

	Abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) is an ongoing management issue in the state of Michigan with eradication from livestock as the ultimate goal. Eradication has been a challenge owing to the presence of a wildlife reservoir; competing interests in managing the livestock and wildlife hosts; and many uncertainties in transmission dynamics of M. bovis. One of the cornerstones of the eradication effort has been to stop movement of infected cattle among farms by imposing strict pre-movement testing on cattle being moved within, into and out of the Modified Accredited Zone (MAZ) in northeastern Michigan. In addition to pre-movement tuberculosis testing, detailed information about the origin and destination premises of all movements within the MAZ has been recorded in Michigan. The aim of this study was to describe the farm-to-farm movements of cattle within the MAZ, report changes in the network of movements during a 6-year period when the MAZ was a constant size (2004-2009), and examine changes in cattle movement patterns when the MAZ was reduced from 11 to 5 counties in 2010. Non-slaughter cattle movement within the MAZ was characterized by predominantly local movements at a sub-county scale. Premises that shipped cattle were primarily senders or receivers, but rarely both. From 2004 to 2009, the number of cattle shipped, size of shipments, number of shipments and distance of shipments decreased; there was little change in the network patterns of interaction among individual premises; and interactions among all premises became more disconnected. After accounting for MAZ size, there were also no changes in cattle movement network patterns following the reduction of the MAZ in 2010. The movement of cattle was likely not a key risk factor in bTB spread among premises in the MAZ during the study period and the effect of zonation and movement regulations appeared to further reduce the risk of tuberculosis spread via cattle movements among farms in Michigan's MAZ.

	Abstract = {Co-infections alter the host immune response but how the systemic and local processes at the site of infection interact is still unclear. The majority of studies on co-infections concentrate on one of the infecting species, an immune function or group of cells and often focus on the initial phase of the infection. Here, we used a combination of experiments and mathematical modelling to investigate the network of immune responses against single and co-infections with the respiratory bacterium Bordetella bronchiseptica and the gastrointestinal helminth Trichostrongylus retortaeformis. Our goal was to identify representative mediators and functions that could capture the essence of the host immune response as a whole, and to assess how their relative contribution dynamically changed over time and between single and co-infected individuals. Network-based discrete dynamic models of single infections were built using current knowledge of bacterial and helminth immunology; the two single infection models were combined into a co-infection model that was then verified by our empirical findings. Simulations showed that a T helper cell mediated antibody and neutrophil response led to phagocytosis and clearance of B. bronchiseptica from the lungs. This was consistent in single and co-infection with no significant delay induced by the helminth. In contrast, T. retortaeformis intensity decreased faster when co-infected with the bacterium. Simulations suggested that the robust recruitment of neutrophils in the co-infection, added to the activation of IgG and eosinophil driven reduction of larvae, which also played an important role in single infection, contributed to this fast clearance. Perturbation analysis of the models, through the knockout of individual nodes (immune cells), identified the cells critical to parasite persistence and clearance both in single and co-infections. Our integrated approach captured the within-host immuno-dynamics of bacteria-helminth infection and identified key components that can be crucial for explaining individual variability between single and co-infections in natural populations.},

	Abstract = {For a decade, technological or natural networks have appeared to have a common mathematical architecture. This type of architecture has a node connectivity which follows a power law distribution. This architecture confers to these networks a resistance property to the loss of nodes. Such properties are advantageous for evolutional networks through time. Thus, this architecture can be expected in animal social networks. Another characteristic commonly met concerns the structuration of the network into communities by the mechanism of assortative mixing by vertex degree (i.e. by the number of ties individuals have). Such a structure is a reflection of evolutional mechanisms: the preferential attachment and the triadic closure processes. Using recent analytical techniques on an affiliative social network in a non-human primate species (Macaca sylvanus), we analysed the mathematical architecture and its properties. We demonstrate that in spite of the use of a recent protocol supposed to permit this type of analysis, the type of distribution cannot be clearly determined, encouraging us to carefully interpret the results obtained until then. Nevertheless, we observed interesting properties of the network at an ecological and evolutional level with network resilience that allows a cohesive society to be maintained even when faced with a catastrophe (high predation, epidemic).

Often, however, territorial populations also include highly mobile, non-residential individuals that potentially serve as disease superspreaders. Using long-term data from the Serengeti Lion Project, we characterize the contact network structure of a territorial wildlife population and address the epidemiological impact of nomadic individuals. As expected, pride contacts are dominated by interactions with neighbouring prides and interspersed by encounters with nomads as they wander throughout the ecosystem. Yet the pride-pride network also includes occasional long-range contacts between prides, making it surprisingly small world and vulnerable to epidemics, even without nomads. While nomads increase both the local and global connectivity of the network, their epidemiological impact is marginal, particularly for diseases with short infectious periods like canine distemper virus. Thus, territoriality in Serengeti lions may be less protective and non-residents less important for disease transmission than previously considered.},

	Abstract = {Mammals are exposed to a diverse array of parasites and infectious diseases, many of which affect host survival and reproduction. Species that live in dense populations, large social groups, or with promiscuous mating systems may be especially vulnerable to infectious diseases owing to the close proximity and higher contact rates among individuals. We review the effects of host density and social contacts on parasite spread and the importance of promiscuity and mating structure for the spread and evolution of sexually transmitted diseases. Host social organization and mating system should influence not only parasite diversity and prevalence but may also determine the fitness advantages of different transmission strategies to parasites. Because host behavior and immune defenses may have evolved to reduce the spread and pathogenicity of infectious diseases, we also consider selective pressures that parasites may exert on host social and mating behavior and the evolutionary responses of hosts at both the immunological and behavioral levels. In examining these issues, we relate modeling results to observations from wild populations, highlighting the similarities and differences among theoretical and empirical approaches. Finally, the epidemiological consequences of host sociality are very relevant to the practical issues of conserving mammalian biodiversity and understanding the interactions between extinction risk and infectious diseases.},

	Abstract = {Heterogeneity in host contact patterns profoundly shapes population-level disease dynamics. Many epidemiological models make simplifying assumptions about the patterns of disease-causing interactions among hosts. In particular, homogeneous-mixing models assume that all hosts have identical rates of disease-causing contacts. In recent years, several network-based approaches have been developed to explicitly model heterogeneity in host contact patterns. Here, we use a network perspective to quantify the extent to which real populations depart from the homogeneous-mixing assumption, in terms of both the underlying network structure and the resulting epidemiological dynamics. We find that human contact patterns are indeed more heterogeneous than assumed by homogeneous-mixing models, but are not as variable as some have speculated. We then evaluate a variety of methodologies for incorporating contact heterogeneity, including network-based models and several modi. cations to the simple SIR compartmental model. We conclude that the homogeneous-mixing compartmental model is appropriate when host populations are nearly homogeneous, and can be modified effectively for a few classes of non-homogeneous networks. In general, however, network models are more intuitive and accurate for predicting disease spread through heterogeneous host populations.},

	Abstract = {Transmission of infectious diseases is strongly influenced by who contacts whom. Despite the global distribution of tuberculosis (TB) in free-living wild mammal populations, little is known of the mechanisms of social transmission of Mycobacterium bovis between individuals. Here, I use a network approach to examine for correlations between five distinct types of intra-and intergroup social interaction and changes in TB status of 110 wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta) in five social groups over two years. Contrary to predictions, the most socially interactive animals were not at highest risk of acquiring infection, indicating that in addition to contact frequency, the type and direction of interactions must be considered when quantifying disease risk. Within social groups, meerkats that groomed others most were more likely to become infected than individuals who received high levels of grooming. Conversely, receiving, but not initiating, aggression was associated with M. bovis infection. Incidence of intergroup roving by male meerkats was correlated with the rovers themselves subsequently testing TB-positive, suggesting a possible route for transmission of infection between social groups. Exposure time was less important than these social interactions in influencing TB risk. This study represents a novel application of social network analysis using empirical data to elucidate the role of specific interactions in the transmission of an infectious disease in a free-living wild animal population.},

	Abstract = {Contact networks are often used in epidemiological studies to describe the patterns of interactions within a population. Often, such networks merely indicate which individuals interact, without giving any indication of the strength or intensity of interactions. Here, we use weighted networks, in which every connection has an associated weight, to explore the influence of heterogeneous contact strengths on the effectiveness of control measures. We show that, by using contact weights to evaluate an individual's influence on an epidemic, individual infection risk can be estimated and targeted interventions such as preventative vaccination can be applied effectively. We use a diary study of social mixing behaviour to indicate the patterns of contact weights displayed by a real population in a range of different contexts, including physical interactions; we use these data to show that considerations of link weight can in some cases lead to improved interventions in the case of infections that spread through close contact interactions. However, we also see that simpler measures, such as an individual's total number of social contacts or even just their number of contacts during a single day, can lead to great improvements on random vaccination. We therefore conclude that, for many infections, enhanced social contact data can be simply used to improve disease control but that it is not necessary to have full social mixing information in order to enhance interventions.

	Abstract = {Gidgee skinks (Egernia stokesii) form large social aggregations in rocky outcrops across the Flinders Ranges in South Australia. Group members share refuges (rock crevices), which may promote parasite transmission. We measured connectivity of individuals in networks constructed from patterns of common crevice use and observed patterns of parasitism by three blood parasites (Hemolivia, Schellackia and Plasmodium) and an ectoparasitic tick (Amblyomma vikirri). Data came from a 1-year mark-recapture study of four populations. Transmission networks were constructed to represent possible transmission pathways among lizards. Two lizards that used the same refuge within an estimated transmission period were considered connected in the transmission network. An edge was placed between them, directed towards the individual that occupied the crevice last. Social networks, a sub-set of same-day only associations, were small and highly fragmented compared with transmission networks, suggesting that non-synchronous crevice use leads to more transmission opportunities than direct social association. In transmission networks, lizards infested by ticks were connected to more other tick-infested lizards than uninfected lizards. Lizards infected by ticks and carrying multiple blood parasite infections were in more connected positions in the network than lizards without ticks or with one or no blood parasites. Our findings suggest higher levels of network connectivity may increase the risk of becoming infected or that parasites influence lizard behaviour and consequently their position in the network.},

@article{gudelj_spatial_2004,
	Abstract = {Social groupings, population dynamics and population movements of animals all give rise to spatio-temporal variations in population levels. These variations may be of crucial importance when considering the spread of infectious diseases since infection levels do not increase unless there is a sufficient pool of susceptible individuals. This paper explores the impact of social groupings on the potential for an endemic disease to develop in a spatially explicit model system. Analysis of the model demonstrates that the explicit inclusion of space allows asymmetry between groups to arise when this was not possible in the equivalent spatially homogeneous system. Moreover, differences in movement behaviours for susceptible and infected individuals gives rise to different spatial profiles for the populations. These profiles were not observed in previous work on an epidemic system. The results are discussed in an ecological context with reference to furious and dumb strains of infectious diseases.

It has attracted particular attention by those attempting to unravel social structure in fission-fusion populations. It is clear that the social network approach offers some exciting opportunities for gaining new insights into social systems. However, some of the practices which are currently being used in the animal social networks literature are at worst questionable and at best over-enthusiastic. We highlight some of the areas of method, analysis and interpretation in which greater care may be needed in order to ensure that the biology we extract from our networks is robust. In particular, we suggest that more attention should be given to whether relational data are representative, the potential effect of observational errors and the choice and use of statistical tests. The importance of replication and manipulation must not be forgotten, and the interpretation of results requires care.},

@article{vanderwaal_quantifying_2014,
	Abstract = {Multi-host wildlife pathogens are an increasing concern for both wildlife conservation and livestock husbandry. Here, we combined social network theory with microbial genetics to assess patterns of interspecific pathogen transmission among ten species of wild and domestic ungulates in Kenya. If two individuals shared the same genetic subtype of a genetically diverse microbe, Escherichia coli, then we inferred that these individuals were part of the same transmission chain. Individuals in the same transmission chain were interlinked to create a transmission network. Given interspecific variation in physiology and behavior, some species may function as "super-spreaders" if individuals of that species are consistently central in the transmission network. Pathogen management strategies targeted at key super-spreader species are theoretically more effective at limiting pathogen spread than conventional strategies, and our approach provides a means to identify candidate super-spreaders in wild populations. We found that Grant's gazelle (Gazella granti) typically occupied central network positions and were connected to a large number of other individuals in the network. Zebra (Equus burchelli), in contrast, seemed to function as bridges between regions of the network that would otherwise be poorly connected, and interventions targeted at zebra significantly increased the level of fragmentation in the network. Although not usually pathogenic, E. coli transmission pathways provide insight into transmission dynamics by demonstrating where contact between species is sufficient for transmission to occur and identifying species that are potential super-spreaders.

	Abstract = {SUMMARYSquirrelpox virus (SQPV) causes a fatal disease in free-living red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) which has contributed to their decline in the United Kingdom. Given the difficulty of carrying out and funding experimental investigations on free-living wild mammals, data collected from closely monitored natural outbreaks of disease is crucial to our understanding of disease epidemiology. A conservation programme was initiated in the 1990s to bolster the population of red squirrels in the coniferous woodland of Thetford Chase, East Anglia. In 1996, 24 red squirrels were reintroduced to Thetford from Northumberland and Cumbria, while in 1999 a captive breeding and release programme commenced, but in both years the success of the projects was hampered by an outbreak of SQPV disease in which seven and four red squirrels died respectively. Valuable information on the host--pathogen dynamics of SQPV disease was gathered by telemetric and mark--recapture monitoring of the red squirrels. SQPV disease characteristics were comparable to other virulent poxviral infections: the incubation period was {\textless}15 days; the course of the disease an average of 10 days and younger animals were significantly more susceptible to disease. SQPV disease places the conservation of the red squirrel in jeopardy in the United Kingdom unless practical disease control methods can be identified.},

	Abstract = {Invasive species have been cited as major causes of population extinctions in several animal and plant classes worldwide. The North American grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) has a major detrimental effect on native red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) populations across Britain and Ireland, in part because it can be a reservoir host for the deadly squirrelpox virus (SQPV). Whilst various researchers have investigated the epizootiology of SQPV disease in grey squirrels and have modelled the consequent effects on red squirrel populations, less work has examined morphological and physiological characteristics that might make individual grey squirrels more susceptible to contracting SQPV. The current study investigated the putative relationships between morphology, parasitism, and SQPV exposure in grey squirrels. We found geographical, sex, and morphological differences in SQPV seroprevalence. In particular, larger animals, those with wide zygomatic arch widths (ZAW), males with large testes, and individuals with concurrent nematode and/or coccidial infections had an increased seroprevalence of SQPV. In addition, males with larger spleens, particularly those with narrow ZAW, were more likely to be exposed to SQPV. Overall these results show that there is variation in SQPV seroprevalence in grey squirrels and that, consequently, certain individual, or populations of, grey squirrels might be more responsible for transmitting SQPV to native red squirrel populations.},

@article{garlick_homogenization_2014,
	Abstract = {Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an infectious prion disease that affects mule deer, along with other Cervids. It is a slow-developing, fatal disease which is rare in the free-ranging deer population of Utah. We present a sex-structured, spatial model for the spread of CWD over heterogeneous landscapes, incorporating both horizontal and environmental transmission pathways. To connect the local movement of deer to the regional spread of CWD, we use ecological diffusion with motility coefficients estimated from mule deer movement data. Ecological diffusion allows for aggregation of populations in desirable habitats and therefore allows for an interaction between density dependent disease transmission and landscape structure. The major innovation presented is use of homogenization to accelerate simulations of disease spread in southeastern Utah, from the La Sal Mountains near Moab to the Abajo Mountains near Monticello. The homogenized model provides accuracy while maintaining fidelity to small-scale habitat effects on deer distribution, including differential aggregation in land cover types with high residence times, with errors comparable to the order parameter measuring separation of small and large scales ( in this case). We use the averaged coefficients from the homogenized model to explore asymptotic invasion speed and the impact of current population size on disease spread in southeastern Utah.},

	Abstract = {Mycobacterium bovis is a pathogen of significant importance in livestock and a wide range of wild animal species worldwide. It is also known to cause tuberculosis disease in humans, a fact which has raised renewed concerns regarding the zoonotic risk for humans, especially those living at the animal-human interface. This review consolidates recent reports in the literature mainly on animal and zoonotic tuberculosis with an emphasis on evolution, epidemiology, treatment and diagnosis. The information presented reveals the fundamental differences in the complexity and level at which the disease affects the economy, ecosystem and human population of regions where animal tuberculosis control is achieved and regions where little or no control is implemented. In conclusion the review suggests that bovine tuberculosis has essentially been reduced to a disease of economic importance in the developed world, while low-income countries are facing a multifaceted impact which potentially affects the health of livestock, humans and ecosystems and which is likely to increase in the presence of debilitating diseases such as HIV/AIDS and other factors which negatively affect human livelihoods.

	Abstract = {Diseases transmitted between wildlife and livestock may have significant impacts on local farmers' health, livestock health and productivity, overall national economies, and conservation initiatives, such as Transfrontier Conservation Areas in Southern Africa. However, little is known on local farmers' awareness of the potential risks, and how they perceive the role played by wildlife in the epidemiology of these diseases.

We investigated the knowledge base regarding livestock diseases of local cattle owners living at the periphery of conservation areas within the Great Limpopo TFCA and the Kavango-Zambezi TFCA in Zimbabwe, using free-listing and semi-structured questionnaires during dipping sessions. The results suggest that information related to cattle diseases circulates widely between cattle farmers, including between different socio-cultural groups, using English and vernacular languages. Most respondents had an accurate perception of the epidemiology of diseases affecting their livestock, and their perception of the potential role played by wildlife species was usually in agreement with current state of veterinary knowledge. However, we found significant variations in the cultural importance of livestock diseases between sites, and owners' perceptions were not directly related with the local abundance of wildlife. As the establishment of TFCAs will potentially increase the risk of Transboundary Animal Diseases, we recommend an increased participation of communities at a local level in the prioritisation of livestock diseases control and surveillance, including zoonoses.},

	Abstract = {It is increasingly recognized that association patterns of most gregarious animals are nonrandom. However, nonrandom patterns can emerge in any population that exhibits spatial structure, even if individuals associate randomly. In species that lack clearly differentiated social relationships characteristic of socially complex mammals, space use patterns must be considered alongside association patterns in order to establish whether nonrandom association patterns are determined by underlying social structure or are merely an artifact of spatial structure. In this study, we simultaneously consider space use and association patterns for a wild population of reticulated giraffe. We examined whether the giraffe's flexible fission-fusion association patterns were embedded in higher levels of social organization. We identified multilevel social organization in which individuals were members of social cliques. Cliques were embedded in larger subcommunities, which in turn were embedded in communities. The frequency with which 2 individuals were observed together was positively correlated with the extent to which their home range overlapped, implying an underlying role of shared space use in determining association patterns. However, membership in cliques and subcommunities was relatively unrelated to space use patterns for males. For females, space use played a much larger role in determining multitiered social organization, which is consistent with a matrilineal-based society characterized by female philopatry. Although giraffe social interactions are highly fluid in nature, it is apparent that association patterns in giraffe are not the result of random fission-fusion events but are embedded within a structured social network characterized by multiple levels of organization.},

	Abstract = {Animal conservation practices include the grouping of captive related and unrelated individuals to form a social structure which is characteristic of that species in the wild. In response to the rapid decline of wild African lion (Panthera leo) populations, an array of conservational strategies have been adopted. Ex situ reintroduction of the African lion requires the construction of socially cohesive pride structures prior to wild release. This pilot study adopted a social network theory approach to quantitatively assess a captive pride's social structure and the relationships between individuals within them. Group composition (who is present in a group) and social interaction data (social licking, greeting, play) was observed and recorded to assess social cohesion within a released semi-wild pride. UCINET and SOCPROG software was utilised to represent and analyse these social networks. Results indicate that the pride is socially cohesive, does not exhibit random associations, and the role of socially influential keystone individuals is important for maintaining social bondedness within a lion pride. These results are potentially informative for h structure of lion prides, in captivity an in the wild, an could have implications for captive and wild-founder reintroductions.},

	Abstract = {The difficulty involved in following mandrills in the wild means that very little is known about social structure in this species. Most studies initially considered mandrill groups to be an aggregation of one-male/multifemale units, with males occupying central positions in a structure similar to those observed in the majority of baboon species. However, a recent study hypothesized that mandrills form stable groups with only two or three permanent males, and that females occupy more central positions than males within these groups. We used social network analysis methods to examine how a semi-free ranging group of 19 mandrills is structured. We recorded all dyads of individuals that were in contact as a measure of association. The betweenness and the eigenvector centrality for each individual were calculated and correlated to kinship, age and dominance. Finally, we performed a resilience analysis by simulating the removal of individuals displaying the highest betweenness and eigenvector centrality values. We found that related dyads were more frequently associated than unrelated dyads. Moreover, our results showed that the cumulative distribution of individual betweenness and eigenvector centrality followed a power function, which is characteristic of scale-free networks. This property showed that some group members, mostly females, occupied a highly central position. Finally, the resilience analysis showed that the removal of the two most central females split the network into small subgroups and increased the network diameter. Critically, this study confirms that females appear to occupy more central positions than males in mandrill groups. Consequently, these females appear to be crucial for group cohesion and probably play a pivotal role in this species.},

@article{grear_network_2013,
	Abstract = {The process of disease transmission is determined by the interaction of host susceptibility and exposure to parasite infectious stages. Host behavior is an important determinant of the likelihood of exposure to infectious stages but is difficult to measure and often assumed to be homogenous in models of disease spread. We evaluated the importance of precisely defining host contact when using networks that estimate exposure and predict infection prevalence in a replicated, empirical system. In particular, we hypothesized that infection patterns would be predicted only by a contact network that is defined according to host behavior and parasite life cycle. Two competing host contact criteria were used to construct networks defined by parasite life cycle and social contacts. First, parasite-defined contacts were based on shared space with a time delay corresponding to the environmental development time of nematode parasites with a direct fecal-oral life cycle. Second, social contacts were defined by shared space in the same time period. To quantify the competing networks of exposure and infection, we sampled natural populations of the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) and infection of their gastrointestinal helminth community using replicated longitudinal capture-mark-recapture techniques. We predicted that (1) infection with parasites with direct fecal-oral life cycles would be explained by the time delay contact network, but not the social contact network; (2) infection with parasites with trophic life cycles (via a mobile intermediate host; thus, spatially decoupling transmission from host contact) would not be explained by either contact network. The prevalence of fecal-oral life cycle nematode parasites was strongly correlated to the number and strength of network connections from the parasite-defined network (including the time delay), while the prevalence of trophic life cycle parasites was not correlated with any network metrics. We concluded that incorporating the parasite life cycle, relative to the way that exposure is measured, is key to inferring transmission and can be empirically quantified using network techniques. In addition, appropriately defining and measuring contacts according the life history of the parasite and relevant behaviors of the host is a crucial step in applying network analyses to empirical systems.},

This permits a statistical regression analysis of the intensity of a recurrent event allowing for complicated censoring patterns and time dependent covariates.

	Abstract = {Infections rarely occur in isolation, and treating one pathogen may have unpredictable effects on another. Ezenwa and Jolles, working on wild African buffaloes, expected that because deworming relieves immune suppression, such treatment would lead to a drop in tuberculosis because the animals would clear the second infection without further intervention. Not so. Deworming did improve the lot of parasite-infested individuals, but it also increased the spread of tuberculosis among the population. What apparently happened is that the worm-free buffalo lived longer but stayed infected with tuberculosis and had longer to spread the infection among the herd.Science, this issue p. 175 Parasitic worms modulate host immune responses in ways that affect microbial co-infections. For this reason, anthelmintic therapy may be a potent tool for indirectly controlling microbial pathogens. However, the population-level consequences of this type of intervention on co-infecting microbes are unknown. We evaluated the effects of anthelmintic treatment on bovine tuberculosis (BTB) acquisition, mortality after infection, and pathogen fitness in free-ranging African buffalo. We found that treatment had no effect on the probability of BTB infection, but buffalo survival after infection was ninefold higher among treated individuals. These contrasting effects translated into an approximately eightfold increase in the reproductive number of BTB for anthelmintic-treated compared with untreated buffalo. Our results indicate that anthelmintic treatment can enhance the spread of microbial pathogens in some real-world situations.},

The efficacy of controls is typically assumed from ``expert opinion'' rather than estimated from data. Managed endemic diseases such as bovine tuberculosis offer the potential to estimate the efficiency of control directly from epidemiological data. Our methodology constitutes a shift in the level of statistical rigor applied to ``policy'' models and offers insights into the epidemiology of Bovine tuberculosis in Great Britain. bTB continues to persist and spread relentlessly in Britain, despite extensive testing and control programs. Cattle farmers question the efficacy of cattle controls, blaming the badger wildlife reservoir. Contrary to much public perception, we demonstrate the importance of cattle-to-cattle transmission, especially in larger herds. We estimate that in the worst case scenario up to 21\% of herds may be harboring infection after they clear restrictions. However, we also estimate that there is a high rate of re-introduction of infection into herds, particularly in high incidence areas. Eliminating the hidden burden of infection alone is unlikely to be sufficient to prevent recurrent breakdowns. Rather, the high rate of external infection, both through cattle movements and environmental sources, must be addressed if recurrence is to be reduced.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {Legislation requiring the pre- and post-movement testing of cattle imported to Scotland from regions with high bovine tuberculosis (bTB) incidence was phased in between September 2005 and May 2006 as part of efforts to maintain Officially Tuberculosis Free (OTF) status. In this analysis, we used centralized cattle movement records to investigate the influence of the legislative change on import movement patterns and the movement-based risk factors associated with new bTB herd breakdowns identified through routine testing or slaughter surveillance. The immediate reduction in the number of import movements from high incidence regions of England and Wales into Scotland suggests that pre- and post-movement testing legislation has had a strong deterrent effect on cattle import trade. Combined with the direct benefits of a more stringent testing regime, this likely explains the observed decrease in the odds of imported cattle subsequently being identified as reactors in herd breakdowns detected through routine surveillance compared to Scottish cattle. However, at the farm-level, herds that recently imported cattle from high incidence regions were still at increased risk of experiencing bTB breakdowns, which highlights the delay between the introduction of disease control measures and detectable changes in incidence. With the relative infrequency of routine herd tests and the insidious nature of clinical signs, past import movements were likely still important in determining the present farm-level risk for bTB breakdown. However, the possibility of low-level transmission between Scottish cattle herds cannot be ruled out given the known issues with test sensitivity, changes in import animal demographics, and the potential for on-farm transmission. Findings from this analysis emphasize the importance of considering how farmer behavioural change in response to policy interventions may influence disease transmission dynamics.},

Some recorded movements of cattle and sheep during the initial phase of the 2001 foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in the UK, before the ban on animal movements was imposed, are analysed descriptively using SNA. With the data available, a directed dichotomized network with 653 nodes and 797 arches was analysed. Most of the 10 nodes with the highest betweenness (3 farms, 4 markets and 3 dealers) were identified as key players in the initial spread of the infection. Three groups of nodes with distinctive proportion of k {\textless}= 2 neighbours would result in three different theoretical outbreak dimension, assuming that the infection is only disseminated by he movement, included in the network: no spread, spread up to 7\% and around 25\%. There are three hierarchical clusters with 308, 215 and 130 nodes, respectively. Farms in cluster I appear to be more similar in their movement patterns to non-farm holdings than to farms in clusters 2 and 3. Relative betweenness, k-neighbours and structural equivalence using hierarchical clustering were able to identify key actors in the evolution of the initial phases of the FMD outbreak such as markets, dealers and farms with atypical movement patterns. Holdings with high betweenness, large number of k {\textless}= 2 neighbours and with movement pattern as in cluster I should be targeted in disease control activities once primary actors like markets, dealers and slaughter houses have been contained.

	Abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) is an ongoing management issue in the state of Michigan with eradication from livestock as the ultimate goal. Eradication has been a challenge owing to the presence of a wildlife reservoir; competing interests in managing the livestock and wildlife hosts; and many uncertainties in transmission dynamics of M. bovis. One of the cornerstones of the eradication effort has been to stop movement of infected cattle among farms by imposing strict pre-movement testing on cattle being moved within, into and out of the Modified Accredited Zone (MAZ) in northeastern Michigan. In addition to pre-movement tuberculosis testing, detailed information about the origin and destination premises of all movements within the MAZ has been recorded in Michigan. The aim of this study was to describe the farm-to-farm movements of cattle within the MAZ, report changes in the network of movements during a 6-year period when the MAZ was a constant size (2004-2009), and examine changes in cattle movement patterns when the MAZ was reduced from 11 to 5 counties in 2010. Non-slaughter cattle movement within the MAZ was characterized by predominantly local movements at a sub-county scale. Premises that shipped cattle were primarily senders or receivers, but rarely both. From 2004 to 2009, the number of cattle shipped, size of shipments, number of shipments and distance of shipments decreased; there was little change in the network patterns of interaction among individual premises; and interactions among all premises became more disconnected. After accounting for MAZ size, there were also no changes in cattle movement network patterns following the reduction of the MAZ in 2010. The movement of cattle was likely not a key risk factor in bTB spread among premises in the MAZ during the study period and the effect of zonation and movement regulations appeared to further reduce the risk of tuberculosis spread via cattle movements among farms in Michigan's MAZ.

	Abstract = {The objective of this investigation was to describe the detection of foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks in nonendemic areas, and to consider how events early in an epidemic influence the epidemic's course. We identified 24 epidemics that occurred between 1992 and 2003 in areas officially considered free of FMD. We obtained information about these epidemics from many sources, including the scientific literature, the grey (non peer-reviewed) literature, and individuals involved with the outbreaks. While most of the epidemics consisted of fewer than 150 infected premises, there were 4 extremely large epidemics, each consisting of more than 2000 infected premises. There was no direct relationship between the time to detection and either the total number of infected premises or the number of animals killed for disease control purposes. We believe that the movement of infected animals through markets was the most critical factor that contributed to the unusual magnitude of the very large epidemics.},

	Abstract = {Objective-To evaluate the differences among each state's Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI) form and the legibility of data on paper ICVIs used to support disease tracing in cattle. Design-Descriptive retrospective cross-sectional study. Sample-Examples of ICVIs from 50 states and 7,630 randomly sampled completed paper ICVIs for cattle from 48 states. Procedures-Differences among paper ICVI forms from all 50 states were determined. Sixteen data elements were selected for further evaluation of their value in tracing cattle. Completed paper ICVIs for interstate cattle exports in 2009 were collected from 48 states. Each of the 16 data elements was recorded as legible, absent, or illegible on forms completed by accredited veterinarians, and results were summarized by state. Mean values for legibility at the state level were used to estimate legibility of data at the national level. Results-ICVIs were inconsistent among states in regard to data elements requested and availability of legible records. A mean +/- SD of 70.0 +/- 22.1\% of ICVIs in each state had legible origin address information. Legible destination address information was less common, with 55.0 +/- 21.4\% of records complete. Incomplete address information was most often a result of the field having been left blank. Official animal identification was present on 33.1\% of ICVIs. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-The inconsistency among state ICVI forms and quality of information provided on paper ICVIs could lead to delays and the need for additional resources to trace cattle, which could result in continued spread of disease. Standardized ICVIs among states and more thorough recording of information by accredited veterinarians or expanded usage of electronic ICVIs could enhance traceability of cattle during an outbreak.},

	Abstract = {We present the first comprehensive description of how shipments of cattle connect the geographic extent and production diversity of the United States cattle industry. We built a network of cattle movement from a state-stratified 10\% systematic sample of calendar year 2009 Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI) data. ICVIs are required to certify the apparent health of cattle moving across state borders and allow us to examine cattle movements at the county scale. The majority of the ICVI sample consisted of small shipments ({\textless}20 head) moved for feeding and beef production. Geographically, the central plains states had the most connections, correlated to feeding infrastructure. The entire nation was closely connected when interstate movements were summarized at the state level. At the county-level, the U.S. is still well connected geographically, but significant heterogeneities in the location and identity of counties central to the network emerge. Overall, the network of interstate movements is described by a hub structure, with a few counties sending or receiving extremely large numbers of shipments and many counties sending and receiving few shipments. The county-level network also has a very low proportion of reciprocal movements, indicating that high-order network properties may be better at describing a county's importance than simple summaries of the number of shipments or animals sent and received. We suggest that summarizing cattle movements at the state level homogenizes the network and a county level approach is most appropriate for examining processes influenced by cattle shipments, such as economic analyses and disease outbreaks.

	Abstract = {Networks are rarely completely observed and prediction of unobserved edges is an important problem, especially in disease spread modeling where networks are used to represent the pattern of contacts. We focus on a partially observed cattle movement network in the U.S. and present a method for scaling up to a full network based on Bayesian inference, with the aim of informing epidemic disease spread models in the United States. The observed network is a 10\% state stratified sample of Interstate Certificates of Veterinary Inspection that are required for interstate movement; describing approximately 20,000 movements from 47 of the contiguous states, with origins and destinations aggregated at the county level. We address how to scale up the 10\% sample and predict unobserved intrastate movements based on observed movement distances. Edge prediction based on a distance kernel is not straightforward because the probability of movement does not always decline monotonically with distance due to underlying industry infrastructure. Hence, we propose a spatially explicit model where the probability of movement depends on distance, number of premises per county and historical imports of animals. Our model performs well in recapturing overall metrics of the observed network at the node level (U.S. counties), including degree centrality and betweenness; and performs better compared to randomized networks. Kernel generated movement networks also recapture observed global network metrics, including network size, transitivity, reciprocity, and assortativity better than randomized networks. In addition, predicted movements are similar to observed when aggregated at the state level (a broader geographic level relevant for policy) and are concentrated around states where key infrastructures, such as feedlots, are common. We conclude that the method generally performs well in predicting both coarse geographical patterns and network structure and is a promising method to generate full networks that incorporate the uncertainty of sampled and unobserved contacts.},

Many epidemiological models make simplifying assumptions about the patterns of disease-causing interactions among hosts. In particular, homogeneous-mixing models assume that all hosts have identical rates of disease-causing contacts. In recent years, several network-based approaches have been developed to explicitly model heterogeneity in host contact patterns. Here, we use a network perspective to quantify the extent to which real populations depart from the homogeneous-mixing assumption, in terms of both the underlying network structure and the resulting epidemiological dynamics. We find that human contact patterns are indeed more heterogeneous than assumed by homogeneous-mixing models, but are not as variable as some have speculated. We then evaluate a variety of methodologies for incorporating contact heterogeneity, including network-based models and several modifications to the simple SIR compartmental model. We conclude that the homogeneous-mixing compartmental model is appropriate when host populations are nearly homogeneous, and can be modified effectively for a few classes of non-homogeneous networks. In general, however, network models are more intuitive and accurate for predicting disease spread through heterogeneous host populations.Keywords: epidemic modelcompartmental modelhomogeneous-mixingcontact networkFootnotesOne contribution of 20 to a Theme Issue `Cross-scale influences on epidemiological dynamics: from genes to ecosystems'.Received May 11, 2007.Accepted June 22, 2007.{\copyright} 2007 The Royal Society},

This network is exceptionally well characterized, as there are legal requirements that the date, source, destination and number of animals be recorded and held on central databases. We identify a percolation threshold in the structure of the livestock network, indicating that, while there is little possibility of a national epidemic of FMD in winter when the catastrophic 2001 epidemic began, there remains a risk in late summer or early autumn. These predictions are corroborated by a non-parametric simulation in which the movements of livestock in 2003 and 2004 are replayed as they occurred. Despite the risk, we show that the network displays small-world properties which can be exploited to target surveillance and control and drastically reduce this risk.Keywords: foot-and-mouth diseasepercolationergodicitydiseasecontrolFootnotesThe electronic supplementary material is available at http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1098/rspb.2006.3505 or via http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk.Received November 23, 2005.Accepted February 3, 2006.{\copyright} 2006 The Royal Society},

	Abstract = {The German trade network of pig holdings and related enterprises for the time period of 01 June 2006--31 December 2008 was analyzed. Available data comprised of the entire German trade information with about 121,287 pig premises and their links in the pork production chain (breeders to slaughter houses). During the study period, 330,000 trade connections between premises were recorded. Communities which are large scale structures comprising of premises which are in close trade contact with each other were detected by modularity maximization. Almost 97\% of the pig holdings could be assigned to one of nine major communities. Contacts between communities are rare. Trade communities do not only form spatial clusters, but were also associated with specific regions within the territory of Germany. Communities are to some extent separated by `trade borders', which may impede disease spread.

	Abstract = {Abstract Social network analysis has recently emerged as a popular tool for understanding disease transmission in host populations. Although social networks have most extensively been applied to modelling the transmission of diseases through human populations, more recently the method has been applied to wildlife populations. The majority of examples from wildlife involve modelling the transmission of contagious microbes (mainly viruses and bacteria), normally in context of understanding wildlife disease epidemics. However, a growing number of studies have used networks to explore the ecology of parasite transmission in wildlife populations for a range of endemic parasites representing a diversity of life cycles and transmission methods. This review addresses the application of network models in representing the transmission of parasites with more complex life cycles, and illustrates the way in which this approach can be used to answer ecological questions about the transmission of parasites in wildlife populations.},

	Abstract = {Communities are sets of nodes that are related in an important way, most likely sharing common properties and/or playing similar roles within a network. Unraveling a network structure, and hence the trade preferences and pathways, could be useful to a researcher or a decision maker. We implemented a community detection algorithm to find livestock communities, which is consistent with the definition of a livestock production zone, assuming that a community is a group of farm premises in which an animal is more likely to stay during its lifetime than expected by chance. We applied this algorithm to the network of animal movements within the state of Mato Grosso for 2007. This database holds information concerning 87,899 premises and 521,431 movements throughout the year, totaling 15,844,779 animals moved. The community detection algorithm achieved a network partition that shows a clear geographical and commercial pattern, two crucial features for preventive veterinary medicine applications; this algorithm provides also a meaningful interpretation to trade networks where links emerge based on trader node choices.},

@article{dutta_characteristics_2014,
	Abstract = {A good knowledge of the specificities of the animal trade network is highly valuable to better control pathogen spread on a large regional to transnational scale. Because of their temporal dynamical nature, studying multi-annual datasets is particularly needed to investigate whether structural patterns are stable over the years. In this study, we analysed the French cattle movement network from 2005 to 2009 for different spatial granularities and temporal windows, with the three-fold objective of exploring temporal variations of the main network characteristics, computing proxies for pathogen spread on this network, which accounts for its time-varying properties and identifying specificities related to the main types of animals and farms (dairy versus beef). Network properties did not qualitatively vary among different temporal and spatial granularities. About 40\% of the holdings and 80\% of the communes were directly interconnected. The width of the aggregation time window barely impacted normalised distributions of indicators. A period of 8-16 weeks would suffice for robust estimation of their main trends, whereas longer periods would provide more details on tails. The dynamic nature of the network could be seen through the small overlap between consecutive networks with 65\% of common active nodes for only 3\% of common links over 2005-2009. To control pathogen spread on such a network, by reducing the largest strongly connected component by more than 80\%, movements should be prevented from 1 to 5\% of the holdings with the highest centrality in the previous year network. The analysis of breed-wise and herd-wise subnetworks, dairy, beef and mixed, reveals similar trends in temporal variation of average indicators and their distributions. The link-based backbones of beef subnetworks seem to be more stable over time than those of other subnetworks. At a regional scale, node reachability accounting for time-respecting paths, as proxy of epidemic burden, is greater for a dairy region than for a beef region. This highlights the importance of considering local specificities and temporal dynamics of animal trade networks when evaluating control measures of pathogen spread. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

An understanding of the underlying contact pattern for a susceptible population is advisable before embarking on any strategy for disease control. The objective of this study was to characterise the network of Danish cattle movements over a 10-year period from 2000 to 2009 with a view to understanding: (1) cohesiveness of the network, (2) influential holdings and (3) structural vulnerability of the network. Network analyses of data involving all cattle movements in Denmark registered during the period of interest were performed. A total of 50,494 premises participated in 4,204,895 individual movements during the 10-year period. The results pointed to a predominantly scale-free structure of the network; though marked by small-world properties in March--April 2001 as well as in 24 other months during the period October 2006 to December 2009. The network was sparsely connected with markets being the key influential holdings. Its vulnerability to removal of markets suggests that targeting highly connected holdings during epidemics should be the focus of control efforts.},

	Abstract = {Registration of cattle and pig movements is mandatory in Sweden and all registered movements between farms in the years 2006-2008 were investigated using network analysis. The networks were analysed as monthly and yearly networks, separately per species and with the two species together. Measures that have been previously discussed in relation to outbreaks and disease control were calculated; moreover a measure of the ingoing infection chain was constructed. The ingoing infection chain captures ingoing contacts through other holdings, taking the temporal aspect and sequence of the movements into account. The distribution of the contacts among the holdings was skewed. Many farms had few or no contacts, while others had many, a pattern which has also been described from other countries. The cattle network and the combined network showed a recurring seasonal pattern, while this was not seen in the pig network. The in-degree was not equivalent to the ingoing infection chain; there were holdings with limited direct contacts, but a large number of indirect contacts. The ingoing infection chain could be a useful measure when setting up strategies for disease control and for risk based surveillance as it identifies holdings with many contacts through live animal movements and thus at potentially higher risk for introduction of contagious diseases.

@article{rautureau_vulnerability_2011,
	Abstract = {P{\textgreater}Besides farming, trade of livestock is a major component of agricultural economy. However, the networks generated by live animal movements are the major support for the propagation of infectious agents between farms, and their structure strongly affects how fast a disease may spread. Structural characteristics may thus be indicators of network vulnerability to the spread of infectious disease. The method proposed here is based upon the analysis of specific subnetworks: the giant strongly connected components (GSCs). Their existence, size and geographic extent are used to assess network vulnerability. Their disappearance when targeted nodes are removed allows studying how network vulnerability may be controlled under emergency conditions. The method was applied to the cattle trade network in France, 2005. Giant strongly connected components were present and widely spread all over the country in yearly, monthly and weekly networks. Among several tested approaches, the most efficient way to make GSCs disappear was based on the ranking of nodes by decreasing betweenness centrality (the proportion of shortest paths between nodes on which a specific node lies). Giant strongly connected components disappearance was obtained after removal of {\textless} 1\% of network nodes. Under emergency conditions, suspending animal trade activities in a small subset of holdings may thus allow to control the spread of an infectious disease through the animal trade network. Nodes representing markets and dealers were widely affected by these simulated control measures. This confirms their importance as 'hubs' for infectious diseases spread. Besides emergency conditions, specific sensitization and preventive measures should be dedicated to this population.},

	Abstract = {Network models are increasingly being used to understand the spread of diseases through sparsely connected populations, with particular interest in the impact of animal movements upon the dynamics of infectious diseases. Detailed data collected by the UK government on the movement of cattle may be represented as a network, where animal holdings are nodes, and an edge is drawn between nodes where a movement of animals has occurred. These network representations may vary from a simple static representation, to a more complex, fully dynamic one where daily movements are explicitly captured. Using stochastic disease simulations, a wide range of network representations of the UK cattle herd are compared. We find that the simpler static network representations are often deficient when compared with a fully dynamic representation, and should therefore be used only with caution in epidemiological modelling. In particular, due to temporal structures within the dynamic network, static networks consistently fail to capture the predicted epidemic behaviour associated with dynamic networks even when parameterized to match early growth rates.},

Contact networks of cattle are generated by geographical proximity and disease is spread through a simple compartmental model on the dynamic contact structures. An analysis of the network metrics of the contact networks and the aggregated contact networks provides insight into the influence of the network dynamics on the epidemic dynamics. Using farm data based on the Kansas cattle industry, our experiments show a tri-modal distribution of total case counts that becomes bi-modal for weaker diseases. These results are explained by the interaction of the disease and trading processes. We show how simple network metrics, such as the average node degree, can track the complex trading processes which shape the evolution of the disease at an agent level.},

	Abstract = {Despite their importance for the spread of zoonotic diseases, our understanding of the dynamical aspects characterizing the movements of farmed animal populations remains limited as these systems are traditionally studied as static objects and through simplified approximations. By leveraging on the network science approach, here we are able for the first time to fully analyze the longitudinal dataset of Italian cattle movements that reports the mobility of individual animals among farms on a daily basis. The complexity and inter-relations between topology, function and dynamical nature of the system are characterized at different spatial and time resolutions, in order to uncover patterns and vulnerabilities fundamental for the definition of targeted prevention and control measures for zoonotic diseases. Results show how the stationarity of statistical distributions coexists with a strong and non-trivial evolutionary dynamics at the node and link levels, on all timescales. Traditional static views of the displacement network hide important patterns of structural changes affecting nodes' centrality and farms' spreading potential, thus limiting the efficiency of interventions based on partial longitudinal information. By fully taking into account the longitudinal dimension, we propose a novel definition of dynamical motifs that is able to uncover the presence of a temporal arrow describing the evolution of the system and the causality patterns of its displacements, shedding light on mechanisms that may play a crucial role in the definition of preventive actions.},

@article{bajardi_optimizing_2012,
	Abstract = {The spatial propagation of many livestock infectious diseases critically depends on the animal movements among premises; so the knowledge of movement data may help us to detect, manage and control an outbreak. The identification of robust spreading features of the system is however hampered by the temporal dimension characterizing population interactions through movements. Traditional centrality measures do not provide relevant information as results strongly fluctuate in time and outbreak properties heavily depend on geotemporal initial conditions. By focusing on the case study of cattle displacements in Italy, we aim at characterizing livestock epidemics in terms of robust features useful for planning and control, to deal with temporal fluctuations, sensitivity to initial conditions and missing information during an outbreak. Through spatial disease simulations, we detect spreading paths that are stable across different initial conditions, allowing the clustering of the seeds and reducing the epidemic variability. Paths also allow us to identify premises, called sentinels, having a large probability of being infected and providing critical information on the outbreak origin, as encoded in the clusters. This novel procedure provides a general framework that can be applied to specific diseases, for aiding risk assessment analysis and informing the design of optimal surveillance systems.},

	Abstract = {We used a simulation study to assess the impact of an incursion of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus on the livestock industries in an 8-county area of the Panhandle region of Texas, USA. The study was conducted in a high-density livestock area, with an estimated number of cattle on-feed of approximately 1.8 million. We modified an existing stochastic, spatial simulation model to simulate 64 scenarios for planning and decision-making. Our scenarios simulated four different herd types for the index herd (company feedlot, backgrounder feedlot, large beef, backyard) and variations in three mitigation strategies (time-of-detection, vaccine availability, and surveillance during disease control). Under our assumptions about availability of resources to manage an outbreak, median epidemic lengths in the scenarios with commercial feedlot, backgrounder feedlot, large beef and backyard index herd types ranged from 28 to 52, 19 to 39, 18 to 32, and 18 to 36 days, respectively, and the average number of herds depopulated ranged from 4 to 101, 2 to 29, 1 to 15 and 1 to 18, respectively. Early detection of FMD in the index herd had the largest impact on reducing ( approximately 13-21 days) the length of epidemics and the number of herds ( approximately 5-34) depopulated. Although most predicted epidemics lasted only approximately 1-2 months, and {\textless}100 herds needed to be depopulated, large outbreaks lasting approximately 8-9 months with up to 230 herds depopulated might occur},

	Abstract = {Globalization has increased the potential for the introduction and spread of novel pathogens over large spatial scales necessitating continental-scale disease models to guide emergency preparedness. Livestock disease spread models, such as those for the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in the United Kingdom, represent some of the best case studies of large-scale disease spread. However, generalization of these models to explore disease outcomes in other systems, such as the United States's cattle industry, has been hampered by differences in system size and complexity and the absence of suitable livestock movement data. Here, a unique database of US cattle shipments allows estimation of synthetic movement networks that inform a near-continental scale disease model of a potential FMD-like (i.e., rapidly spreading) epidemic in US cattle. The largest epidemics may affect over one-third of the US and 120,000 cattle premises, but cattle movement restrictions from infected counties, as opposed to national movement moratoriums, are found to effectively contain outbreaks. Slow detection or weak compliance may necessitate more severe state-level bans for similar control. Such results highlight the role of large-scale disease models in emergency preparedness, particularly for systems lacking comprehensive movement and outbreak data, and the need to rapidly implement multi-scale contingency plans during a potential US outbreak.},

The foundations of epidemiology and early epidemiological models were based on population wide random-mixing, but in practice each individual has a finite set of contacts to whom they can pass infection; the ensemble of all such contacts forms a `mixing network'. Knowledge of the structure of the network allows models to compute the epidemic dynamics at the population scale from the individual-level behaviour of infections. Therefore, characteristics of mixing networks---and how these deviate from the random-mixing norm---have become important applied concerns that may enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns and intervention measures.Here, we review the basis of epidemiological theory (based on random-mixing models) and network theory (based on work from the social sciences and graph theory). We then describe a variety of methods that allow the mixing network, or an approximation to the network, to be ascertained. It is often the case that time and resources limit our ability to accurately find all connections within a network, and hence a generic understanding of the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics is needed. Therefore, we review some of the variety of idealized network types and approximation techniques that have been utilized to elucidate this link. Finally, we look to the future to suggest how the two fields of network theory and epidemiological modelling can deliver an improved understanding of disease dynamics and better public health through effective disease control.Keywords: transmissioninfectioncontact-tracingrandom networksmall-world networkscale-free networkFootnotesReceived February 17, 2005.Accepted May 16, 2005.{\copyright} 2005 The Royal Society},

@misc{doherr_targeted_2001,
	Abstract = {In Switzerland, the first case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was diagnosed in November 1990. Case numbers peaked in 1995, with a total of 352 BSE cases identified by 30 April 2000. Reporting of clinically suspect cattle is currently the most commonly used method worldwide to detect BSE cases. The effectiveness of mandatory reporting depends on a variety of factors; for other diseases passive surveillance underestimates the incidence of clinical cases. The efficiency of passive surveillance systems for BSE will remain unknown until screening tests able to identify clinically affected cattle have been applied in several countries. This paper provides the first detailed description of a targeted screening programme for BSE. Two populations of cows {\textgreater}24 months of age were included in the targeted screening: (i) cows found dead or culled on site where the carcass was submitted to rendering (fallen stock) and (ii) cows with health-related problems unfit for routine slaughter that were slaughtered under emergency procedures (emergency slaughter). Between 1992 and 1999, on average 81 clinical BSE suspects per year were reported to the veterinary authorities (passive surveillance), of which 43\% were confirmed with BSE. A total of 30 clinical cases were captured by passive surveillance and an additional 20 BSE cases detected by targeted screening between May 1999 and April 2000. The odds of finding a BSE case was 49 times higher in the fallen stock and 58 times higher in emergency-slaughtered cattle when compared to passive surveillance. The targeted screening of fallen stock and emergency-slaughtered cattle considerably increased the number of detected cases in this 12-month period. Targeted-screening cases were on average 4 months younger than the clinical suspect cases. In conclusion, post-mortem testing of fallen stock and emergency-slaughtered cows {\textgreater}24 months for BSE is an important active surveillance element within a total surveillance system that principally is based on mandatory reporting of clinical suspect ca.,es. Without ante-mortem screening tests to detect BSE-infected cattle during the incubation period, a combination of effectively functioning passive and active BSE surveillance strategies might be the only approach to assess the BSE situation reliably in a given country or region - and it is necessary to substantiate claims of freedom from the disease.

	Abstract = {Consequences of classical swine fever (CSF) epidemics depend on the control measures, but also on the number of infected herds at the end of the high-risk period (HRP). Surveillance programmes aim to keep this number as low as possible, so the effectiveness of surveillance programmes can be measured by the number of infected herds at the end of the HRP. In this paper, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the following five Dutch CSF surveillance programmes is presented: (1) routine gross pathology of severely diseased pigs; (2) routine virological tests of tonsils of all pigs, submitted under 1; (3) daily clinical observation by the farmer; (4) periodic clinical inspection by a veterinarian; (5) leucocyte counts in blood samples from diseased animals on a herd where antimicrobial 'group therapy' is started. The evaluation was done by a modelling study, in which virus transmission, disease development, and actions and diagnostic tests in surveillance programmes were simulated. Also, the yearly costs of the programmes were calculated, and direct costs of CSF epidemics were related to the number of infected herds at the end of the HRP. It appeared that the current Dutch surveillance programmes, without the leucocyte counts, keep the number of infected herds at the end of the HRP below 20 with 95\% probability. Leaving out the most-expensive programme of periodic inspection (12.5M per year) does not change this result - indicating that (for CSF surveillance) the programme could well be stopped. If the leucocyte programme, which is currently not effective due to the low sample submission rate, optimally were applied, the 95th percentile could be reduced to 10 infected herds. However, whether application is beneficial is unclear, because of uncertainty of the economic benefits due to the many expected false-positive herds each year},

	Abstract = {The authors describe a comprehensive system for public health surveillance for the United States based on a network of data systems ranging from population surveys and physician-based records to electronically linked laboratory and administrative data. They also discuss traditional uses of surveillance data, legal and ethical issues associated with using data from any surveillance system (particularly the tension between individual privacy and the public right to a healthful environment), and factors impeding the development of a comprehensive system. Just as provisional data on notifiable diseases are critical in protecting communities from disease, data from other information systems should be applied to prevention practice with the same urgency. The major barriers to a successful comprehensive, nationwide, integrated public health surveillance and information system are a lack of appreciation for the value of high-quality provisional surveillance data and a weak societal commitment to public health.},

@article{stark_concepts_2006,
	Abstract = {Background: Emerging animal and zoonotic diseases and increasing international trade have resulted in an increased demand for veterinary surveillance systems. However, human and financial resources available to support government veterinary services are becoming more and more limited in many countries world-wide. Intuitively, issues that present higher risks merit higher priority for surveillance resources as investments will yield higher benefit-cost ratios. The rapid rate of acceptance of this core concept of risk-based surveillance has outpaced the development of its theoretical and practical bases. Discussion: The principal objectives of risk-based veterinary surveillance are to identify surveillance needs to protect the health of livestock and consumers, to set priorities, and to allocate resources effectively and efficiently. An important goal is to achieve a higher benefit-cost ratio with existing or reduced resources. We propose to define risk-based surveillance systems as those that apply risk assessment methods in different steps of traditional surveillance design for early detection and management of diseases or hazards. In risk-based designs, public health, economic and trade consequences of diseases play an important role in selection of diseases or hazards. Furthermore, certain strata of the population of interest have a higher probability to be sampled for detection of diseases or hazards. Evaluation of risk-based surveillance systems shall prove that the efficacy of risk-based systems is equal or higher than traditional systems; however, the efficiency ( benefit-cost ratio) shall be higher in risk-based surveillance systems. Summary: Risk-based surveillance considerations are useful to support both strategic and operational decision making. This article highlights applications of risk-based surveillance systems in the veterinary field including food safety. Examples are provided for risk-based hazard selection, risk-based selection of sampling strata as well as sample size calculation based on risk considerations.},

	Abstract = {Infectious disease ecology has recently raised its public profile beyond the scientific community due to the major threats that wildlife infections pose to biological conservation, animal welfare, human health and food security. As we start unravelling the full extent of emerging infectious diseases, there is an urgent need to facilitate multidisciplinary research in this area. Even though research in ecology has always had a strong theoretical component, cultural and technical hurdles often hamper direct collaboration between theoreticians and empiricists. Building upon our collective experience of multidisciplinary research and teaching in this area, we propose practical guidelines to help with effective integration among mathematical modelling, fieldwork and laboratory work. Modelling tools can be used at all steps of a field-based research programme, from the formulation of working hypotheses to field study design and data analysis. We illustrate our model-guided fieldwork framework with two case studies we have been conducting on wildlife infectious diseases: plague transmission in prairie dogs and lyssavirus dynamics in American and African bats. These demonstrate that mechanistic models, if properly integrated in research programmes, can provide a framework for holistic approaches to complex biological systems.},

	Abstract = {Many endangered wildlife populations are vulnerable to infectious diseases for which vaccines exist; yet, pragmatic considerations often preclude large-scale vaccination efforts. These barriers could be reduced by focusing on individuals with the highest contact rates. However, the question then becomes whether targeted vaccination is sufficient to prevent large outbreaks. To evaluate the efficacy of targeted wildlife vaccinations, we simulate pathogen transmission and control on monthly association networks informed by behavioural data from a wild chimpanzee community (Kanyawara N = 37, Kibale National Park, Uganda). Despite considerable variation across monthly networks, our simulations indicate that targeting the most connected individuals can prevent large outbreaks with up to 35\% fewer vaccines than random vaccination. Transmission heterogeneities might be attributed to biological differences among individuals (e. g. sex, age, dominance and family size). Thus, we also evaluate the effectiveness of a trait-based vaccination strategy, as trait data are often easier to collect than interaction data. Our simulations indicate that a trait-based strategy can prevent large outbreaks with up to 18\% fewer vaccines than random vaccination, demonstrating that individual traits can serve as effective estimates of connectivity. Overall, these results suggest that fine-scale behavioural data can help optimize pathogen control efforts for endangered wildlife.},

There are many recent examples of disease spread that have occurred as a result of intentional movements of livestock or wildlife. Understanding the volume of these movements and the risks associated with them is fundamental in elucidating the epidemiology of these diseases, some of which might entail zoonotic risks. The importance of the worldwide animal trade is reviewed and the role of the unregulated trade in animals is highlighted. A range of key examples are discussed in which animal movements have resulted in the introduction of pathogens to previously disease-free areas.

@article{elbers_classical_1999,
	Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to describe the severe epidemic of classical swine fever (CSF) in The Netherlands in 1997-1998 under a policy of non-vaccination, intensive surveillance, preemptive slaughter and stamping out in an area which has one of the highest pig and herd densities in Europe. The primary outbreak was detected on 4 February 1997 on a mixed sow and finishing pig herd. A total of 429 outbreaks was observed during the epidemic, and approximately 700 000 pigs from these herds were slaughtered. Among these outbreaks were two artificial insemination centres, which resulted in a CSF-suspect declaration of 1680 pig herds (mainly located in the southern part of The Netherlands). The time between introduction of CSF virus (CSFV) into the country and diagnosis of CSF in the primary outbreak was estimated to be approximately 6 weeks. It is presumed that CSFV was spread from The Netherlands to Italy and Spain via shipment of infected piglets in the beginning of February 1997, before the establishment of a total stand-still of transportation. In June 1997, CSFV is presumed to be introduced into Belgium from The Netherlands. Pre-emptive slaughter of herds that had been in contact with infected herds or were located in close vicinity of infected herds, was carried out around the first two outbreaks. However, this policy was not further exercised till mid-April 1997, when pre-emptive slaughter became a standard operational procedure for the rest of the epidemic. In total, 1286 pig herds were pre-emptively slaughtered. (approximately 1.1 million pigs). A total of 44 outbreaks (10\%) was detected via preemptive slaughter. When there were clinical signs, the observed symptoms in infected herds were mainly atypical: fever, apathy, ataxia or a combination of these signs. In 322 out of 429 outbreaks (75\%), detection was bases on clinical signs observed: 32\% was detected by the farmer, 25\% by the veterinary practitioner, 10\% of the outbreaks by tracing teams and 8\% by screening teams of the veterinary authorities. In 76\% of the outbreaks detected by clinical signs, the farmer reported to have seen clinical symptoms for less than I week before diagnosis, in 22\% for 1-4 weeks before diagnosis, and in 4 herds (1\%) the farmer reported to have seen clinical symptoms for more than 4 weeks before diagnosis. Transportation lorries played a major role in the transmission of CSFV before the primary outbreak was diagnosed. It is estimated that approximately 39 herds were already infected before the first measures of the eradication campaign came into force. After the first measures to stop the spread of CSFV had been implemented, the distribution of the most likely routes of transmission markedly changed. In most outbreaks, a neighbourhood infection was indicated. Basically, there were two reasons for this catastrophe. Firstly, there was the extent of the period between introduction of the virus in the region and detection of the first outbreak. As a result, CSFV had opportunities to spread from one herd to another during this period. Secondly, the measures initially taken did not prove sufficient in the swine- and herd-dense region involved. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The network of animal movements among livestock premises is an important topological structure for the spread of infectious diseases. The central focus of this study was to analyze strategies for selecting premises based on the friendship paradox ("your friends have more friends than you do") - in which premises that neighbor randomly selected premises are sampled for surveillance or control - to determine whether these strategies are viable alternatives for the surveillance and control of diseases in scenarios with insufficient data on animal movement. To test the effectiveness of these strategies, we performed three sets of simulations. In the first set, we examined the risk of spreading an infectious disease using the cattle movement network of the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. All tested strategies based on the friendship paradox have comparable performance to the hub control strategy (controlling premises that sold more animals) and superior performance to random sampling in terms of both reducing the risk of purchasing infected animals and the number of premises that need to be controlled. In the second and third sets of simulations, we observed that the friendship paradox strategies were more sensitive than the random sampling strategy to detect cases and disease, respectively. The survey of the entire animal movement network to identify animal premises with a key role in trade is not always possible, either because the data are insufficient or because informal trade is significant. If surveying the network is not possible, all approaches based on knowledge of the network become useless. As an alternative, knowing that there is a hidden movement network that follows rules inherent to all networks, such as the friendship paradox, can be used to our advantage. Strategies based on the friendship paradox do not assume knowledge of the animal movement network and therefore may be viable alternatives for the surveillance or control of infectious diseases in the absence of network information, thus optimizing the use of human and financial resources.

Because of the computational demands of these methods, many researchers have sought to use measures of network structure to modify analytically tractable differential equation models. Several of these studies have focused on the degree distribution of the contact network as the basis for their modifications. We show that although degree distribution is sufficient to predict disease behaviour on very sparse or very dense human contact networks, for intermediate density networks we must include information on clustering and path length to accurately predict disease behaviour. Using these three metrics, we were able to explain more than 98 per cent of the variation in endemic disease levels in our stochastic simulations. contact networksclustering coefficientmean path lengthexponential degree distributiondisease modellingReceived February 8, 2011.Accepted April 5, 2011.This journal is {\copyright} 2011 The Royal Society},

Temporal dynamics are a key issue for many ecological and evolutionary questions. These dynamics include both changes in network topology and flow on the network. Network analyses that ignore or do not adequately account for the temporal dynamics can result in inappropriate inferences. 2. We suggest that existing methods are currently under-utilized in many ecological and evolutionary network analyses and that the broader incorporation of these methods will considerably advance the current field. Our goal is to introduce ecologists and evolutionary biologists interested in studying network dynamics to extant ideas and methodological approaches, at a level appropriate for those new to the field. 3. We present an overview of time-ordered networks, which provide a framework for analysing network dynamics that addresses multiple inferential issues and permits novel types of temporally informed network analyses. We review available methods and software, discuss the utility and considerations of different approaches, provide a worked example analysis and highlight new research opportunities in ecology and evolutionary biology.},

	Abstract = {The use of social and contact networks to answer basic and applied questions about infectious disease transmission in wildlife and livestock is receiving increased attention. Through social network analysis, we understand that wild animal and livestock populations, including farmed fish and poultry, often have a heterogeneous contact structure owing to social structure or trade networks. Network modelling is a flexible tool used to capture the heterogeneous contacts of a population in order to test hypotheses about the mechanisms of disease transmission, simulate and predict disease spread, and test disease control strategies. This review highlights how to use animal contact data, including social networks, for network modelling, and emphasizes that researchers should have a pathogen of interest in mind before collecting or using contact data. This paper describes the rising popularity of network approaches for understanding transmission dynamics in wild animal and livestock populations; discusses the common mismatch between contact networks as measured in animal behaviour and relevant parasites to match those networks; and highlights knowledge gaps in how to collect and analyse contact data.

	Abstract = {The Netherlands holds the bovine tuberculosis-free (BTB-free) status according to European Union standards, but in recent years small outbreaks of the infection have occurred. After the last outbreak in 1999 with 10 infected herds the question raised if the current surveillance system, visual inspection of carcasses at the slaughterhouse, is efficient enough to detect infected cattle in time and to maintain the official BTB-free status. Through epidemiological modelling, the risk of a major outbreak is quantified, using one of six surveillance strategies. These are the currently used visual inspection of carcasses at the slaughterhouse (SL), the ELISA test on blood samples of carcasses at the slaughterhouse (ELISA-B), the gamma-interferon test on blood samples of carcasses at the slaughterhouse (GAMMA-B), comparative tuberculination of the herd (CT), the combined method of single and comparative tuberculination of the herd (ST+CT) and the ELISA test on samples of bulk milk (ELISA-M). Test frequency of the last three methods was varied as well. A stochastic individual based model (IBM) was developed to simulate a chain of infected herds, where each individual animal is followed in time. The model mimics the nation-wide situation after the introduction of one infected animal into one herd. BTB-transmission is simulated with an S-E(1)-E(2)-I state transition model. Output is time until detection of the infection, prevalence in the detected herd and the number of infected herds at the time of detection. For the assessment 500 simulations were used, representing 500 BTB-introductions. Model robustness to parameter values was analysed with Monte Carlo elasticity analysis, for which 1000 simulations were used. Results of median time until detection and median number of infected farms at detection for SL (302 weeks and seven farms) were in agreement with estimates from an outbreak in the Netherlands in 1999. ELISA-B and GAMMA-B performed better than SL with a much lower median time until detection (189 and 97 weeks, respectively). The results for the tuberculination methods (ST+CT and CT) and ELISA-M depended heavily on the frequency in which the tests were performed. The tuberculination methods ST+CT and CT yield comparable results and detect the infection sooner than SL, also at the lowest tested frequency of once in 5 years. ELISA-M is comparable with SL at frequencies of once in 4 or 5 years, and this test works well at frequencies of once a year or higher. Our study results are used for an economical optimisation analysis of the six surveillance strategies},

	Abstract = {An efficient surveillance system is a crucial factor in identifying, monitoring and tackling outbreaks of infectious diseases. Scarcity of data and limited amounts of economic resources require a targeted effort from public health authorities. In this paper, we propose a mathematical method to identify areas where surveillance is critical and low reporting rates might leave epidemics undetected. Our approach combines the use of reference-based susceptible-exposed-infectious models and observed reporting data; We propose two different specifications, for constant and time-varying surveillance, respectively. Our case study is centred around the spread of the raccoon rabies epidemic in the state of New York, using data collected between 1990 and 2007. Both methods offer a feasible solution to analyse and identify areas of intervention},

@article{good_performance_2010-1,
	Abstract = {Although widely used in practice, the behavior and accuracy of the popular module identification technique called modularity maximization is not well understood in practical contexts. Here, we present a broad characterization of its performance in such situations. First, we revisit and clarify the resolution limit phenomenon for modularity maximization. Second, we show that the modularity function Q exhibits extreme degeneracies: it typically admits an exponential number of distinct high-scoring solutions and typically lacks a clear global maximum. Third, we derive the limiting behavior of the maximum modularity Q(max) for one model of infinitely modular networks, showing that it depends strongly both on the size of the network and on the number of modules it contains. Finally, using three real-world metabolic networks as examples, we show that the degenerate solutions can fundamentally disagree on many, but not all, partition properties such as the composition of the largest modules and the distribution of module sizes. These results imply that the output of any modularity maximization procedure should be interpreted cautiously in scientific contexts. They also explain why many heuristics are often successful at finding high-scoring partitions in practice and why different heuristics can disagree on the modular structure of the same network. We conclude by discussing avenues for mitigating some of these behaviors, such as combining information from many degenerate solutions or using generative models.},

	Abstract = {Livestock movements in Great Britain (GB) are well recorded and are a unique record of the network of connections among livestock-holding locations. These connections can be critical for disease spread, as in the 2001 epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the UK. Here, the movement data are used to construct an individual-farm-based model of the initial spread of FMD in GB and determine the susceptibility of the GB livestock industry to future outbreaks under the current legislative requirements. Transmission through movements is modelled, with additional local spread unrelated to the known movements. Simulations show that movements can result in a large nationwide epidemic, but only if cattle are heavily involved, or the epidemic occurs in late summer or early autumn. Inclusion of random local spread can considerably increase epidemic size, but has only a small impact on the spatial extent of the disease. There is a geographical bias in the epidemic size reached, with larger epidemics originating in Scotland and the north of England than elsewhere.},

	Abstract = {Partitioning of contact networks into communities allows groupings of epidemiologically related nodes to be derived, that could inform the design of disease surveillance and control strategies, e.g. contact tracing or design of 'firebreaks' for disease spread. However, these are only of merit if they persist longer than the timescale of interventions. Here, we apply different methods to identify concordance between network partitions across time for two animal trading networks, those of salmon in Scotland (2002-2004) and livestock in Great Britain (2003-2004). Both trading networks are similar in that they moderately agree over time in terms of their community structures, but this concordance is higher - and therefore community structure is more consistent - when only the 'core' network of nodes involved in trading over the whole time series is considered. In neither case was higher agreement found between partitions close together in time. These measures differ in their absolute values unless appropriate standardisation is applied. Once standardised, the measures gave similar values for both network types. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {We analyse the relationship between the network of livestock movements in the UK and the dynamics of two diseases: foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), which has an incubation period of days, and scrapie, which incubates over years. For FMD, the time-scale of expected epidemics is similar to the time-scale of the evolution of the network. We argue that, under appropriate conditions, a static network analysis can be an appropriate tool for gaining insights into disease dynamics even when the relevant time-scales are similar, as with FMD. We show that a subclass of 'linkage moves' maintains the network structure, and so removing these links has a dramatic effect on the number of potentially infected farms, an effect corroborated by simulations. In contrast, because scrapie has a low probability of transmission per contact and a long incubation period, a static network representation is probably appropriate; however, the signature of the network in the pattern of transmission is likely to be faint. Scrapie-notifying farms were more likely to be associated with each other via trading at markets than were control farms; however, network community structure proves to be less representative of prevalence patterns than geographical region. These contradictory indicators emphasize that appropriate observation time frames and good discrimination among types of potentially infectious contacts are vital in order for network analysis to be a valuable epidemiological tool.},

	Abstract = {Australia, as a relatively isolated country with a high level of agricultural production, depends on, and has the opportunity to maintain, freedom from a range of important diseases of livestock. Occasional incursions of such diseases are generally detected by 'passive', general surveillance (GS). In current surveillance planning, a risk-based approach has been taken to optimising allocation of resources to surveillance needs, and having mapped the relative risk of introduction and establishment of diseases of concern, a means of mapping the efficacy of GS for their detection was required, as was a means of assessing the likely efficacy of options for improving GS efficacy if needed. This paper presents the structure and application of a tool for estimating the efficacy of Australia's GS, using the example of foot and mouth disease (FMD). The GS assessment tool (GSAT) is a stochastic spreadsheet model of the detection, diagnosis and reporting of disease on a single infected farm. It utilises the output of an intraherd disease spread model to determine the duration and prevalence of infection on different types of farm. It was applied separately to each of twelve regions of Australia, demarcated by dominant livestock production practices. Each region supplied estimates of probabilities relevant to the detection of FMD, for each of fourteen farm types and all species susceptible to the disease. Outputs of the GSAT were the average probability that FMD on the farm would be detected (single farm sensitivity), the average time elapsed from incursion of the disease to the chief veterinary officer (CVO) being notified (time to detection), and the number of average properties that would need to be infected before the CVO could be 95\% confident of detecting at least one. The median single farm sensitivity for FMD varied among regions from 0.23 to 0.52, the median time to detection from 20 to 33 days, and the number of properties infected for 95\% confidence of detecting at least one from 4 to 12. The GSAT has proved a valuable tool in planning surveillance for detection of exotic livestock disease in Australia, and it provides a practical example of the use of probabilistic modelling to answer important questions in the face of imperfect information.

For the control policy which best approximated that actually implemented from late Match, the model predicted an epidemic of approximately 1800 to 1900 affected farms, and estimated that the epidemic would be eradicated between July and October 2001, with a low probability of continuing beyond October 2001. This policy included the slaughter-out of infected farms within 24 hours, slaughter of about 1.3 of the surrounding farms per infected farm within a further 48 hours, and minimal interfarm movements of susceptible animals. Delays in the slaughter of animals on infected farms beyond 24 hours after diagnosis slightly increased the epidemic size, and failure to achieve pre-emptive slaughter on an adequate number of at-risk farms substantially increased the expected size of the epidemic. Vaccination of up to three of the most outbreak-dense areas carried out in conjunction with the adopted control policy reduced the predicted size of the epidemic by less than 100 farms. Vaccination of buffer zones (designed to apply available vaccine and manpower as effectively as possible) carried out in place of the adopted control policy allowed the disease to spread out of control, producing an epidemic involving over 6000 farms by October 2001, with no prospect of immediate eradication.},

	Abstract = {Madagascar's 36.5-million-head poultry industry holds a foremost place in its economy and the livelihood of its people. Unfortunately, regular Newcastle disease outbreaks associated with high mortality causes high losses for smallholders and threatens their livelihood. Therefore, Madagascar is seeking concrete, achievable and sustainable methods for the surveillance and the control of Newcastle disease. In this paper, we present and analyze the results of a field study conducted in Madagascar between December 2009 and December 2010. The study area was the Lac Alaotra region, a landlocked area in the north-eastern part of the country's center. Poultry trading is suspected of playing a major role in the spread of avian diseases, especially in developing countries characterized by many live-bird markets and middlemen. Therefore, the goals of our study were to: (i) describe and analyze smallholders' poultry trading network in the Lake Alaotra region using social network analysis; (ii) assess the role of the network in the spread of Newcastle disease; and (iii) propose the implementation of a targeted disease surveillance based on the characteristics of the poultry trading network. We focused our field study on the harvesting of two data sets. The first is a complete description of the poultry trading network in the landlocked area of Lac Alaotra, including a description of the poultry movements between groups of villages. The second set of data measures the occurrence of outbreaks in the same area by combining a participatory approach with an event-based surveillance method. These data were used to determine the attributes of the network, and to statistically assess the association between the position of nodes and the occurrence of outbreaks. By using social network analysis techniques combined with a classification method and a logistic model, we finally identified 3 nodes (set of villages), of the 387 in the initial network, to focus on for surveillance and control in the Lac Alaotra area. This result is of primary importance in the ongoing efforts to effectively improve the wellbeing of people in the region},

	Abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) was first detected in 2005 in cattle in northwestern Minnesota (MN) through slaughter surveillance. By the end of 2008,12 cattle herds were infected with bTB, and the main cause for infection was determined to be the movement of infected animals between herds. Bovine tuberculosis was contained in a smaller area in northwestern Minnesota classified as modified accredited (MA), corresponding to a prevalence inferior to 0.1\% in cattle. From January 2008 to 2011, all cattle movements within the bTB MA were recorded electronically. The primary objectives of this study were to characterize cattle movements within this region and identify cattle herds with higher risk of bTB introduction based on network parameters and known risk factors from the published literature. During the period that data was collected, 57,460 cattle were moved in 3762 movements corresponding to permits issued to 682 premises, mostly representing private farms, sale yards, slaughter facilities and county or state fairs. Although sale yards represented less than 2\% of the premises (nodes), 60\% of the movements were to or from a sale yard. The network showed an overall density of 0.4\%, a clustering coefficient of 14.6\% and a betweenness centralization index of 12.7\%, reflecting the low connectivity of this cattle network. The degree distribution showed that 20\% of nodes performed 90\% of the movements. Farms were ranked based on the total risk score and divided into high, medium, and low risk groups based on the score and its variability. The higher risk group included 14\% (n = 50) of the farms, corresponding to 80\% of the cumulative risk for the farms in the bTB area. This analysis provides a baseline description about the contact structure of cattle movements in an area previously infected with bTB and develops a framework for a targeted surveillance approach for bTB to support future surveillance decisions.

@article{riley_large-scale_2007,
	Abstract = {During transmission of seasonal endemic diseases such as measles and influenza, spatial waves of infection have been observed between large distant populations. Also, during the initial stages of an outbreak of a new or reemerging pathogen, disease incidence tends to occur in spatial clusters, which makes containment possible if you can predict the subsequent spread of disease. Spatial models are being used with increasing frequency to help characterize these large-scale patterns and to evaluate the impact of interventions. Here, I review several recent studies on four diseases that show the benefits of different methodologies: measles (patch models), foot-and-mouth disease (distance-transmission models), pandemic influenza (multigroup models), and smallpox (network models). This review highlights the importance of the household in spatial studies of human diseases, such as smallpox and influenza. It also demonstrates the need to develop a simple model of household demographics, so that these large-scale models can be extended to the investigation of long--time scale human pathogens, such as tuberculosis and HIV.},

	Abstract = {The characterization of cattle demographics and especially movements is an essential component in the modeling of dynamics in cattle systems, yet for cattle systems of the United States (US), this is missing. Through a large-scale maximum entropy optimization formulation, we estimate cattle movement parameters to characterize the movements of cattle across 10 Central States and 1034 counties of the United States. Inputs to the estimation problem are taken from the United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service database and are pre-processed in a pair of tightly constrained optimization problems to recover non-disclosed elements of data. We compare stochastic subpopulation-based movements generated from the estimated parameters to operation-based movements published by the United States Department of Agriculture. For future Census of Agriculture distributions, we propose a series of questions that enable improvements for our method without compromising the privacy of cattle operations. Our novel method to estimate cattle movements across large US regions characterizes county-level stratified subpopulations of cattle for data-driven livestock modeling. Our estimated movement parameters suggest a significant risk level for US cattle systems.},

@article{smith_minimization_2013,
	Abstract = {The objective of this study was to minimize the cost of controlling an isolated bovine tuberculosis (bTB) outbreak in a US dairy herd, using a stochastic simulation model of bTB with economic and biological layers. A model optimizer produced a control program that required 2-month testing intervals (TI) with 2 negative whole-herd tests to leave quarantine. This control program minimized both farm and government costs. In all cases, test-and-removal costs were lower than depopulation costs, although the variability in costs increased for farms with high holding costs or small herd sizes. Increasing herd size significantly increased costs for both the farm and the government, while increasing indemnity payments significantly decreased farm costs and increasing testing costs significantly increased government costs. Based on the results of this model, we recommend 2-month testing intervals for herds after an outbreak of bovine tuberculosis, with 2 negative whole herd tests being sufficient to lift quarantine. A prolonged test and cull program may cause a state to lose its bTB-free status during the testing period. When the cost of losing the bTB-free status is greater than \$1.4 million then depopulation of farms could be preferred over a test and cull program},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The success of tracing cattle to the herd of origin after the detection and confirmation of bovine tuberculosis (TB) lesions in cattle at slaughter is a critical component of the national bovine TB eradication program in the United States (U.S.). The aims of this study were to 1) quantify the number of bovine TB cases identified at slaughter that were successfully traced to their herd of origin in the U.S. during 2001-2010, 2) quantify the number of successful traceback investigations that found additional TB infected animals in  the herd of origin or epidemiologically linked herds, and 3) describe the forms of animal identification present on domestic bovine TB cases and their association with traceback success. RESULTS: We analyzed 2001-2010 data in which  371 granulomatous lesions were confirmed as bovine TB. From these 114 bovine TB cases, 78 adults (i.e. sexually intact bovines greater than two years of age), and 36 fed (i.e. less than or equal to two years of age) were classified as domestic cattle (U.S. originated). Of these adults and fed cases, 83\% and 13\% were successfully traced, respectively. Of these traceback investigations, 70\% of adult cases and 50\% of fed cases identified additional bovine TB infected animals in the herd of origin or an epidemiologically linked herd. We found that the presence of various forms of animal identification on domestic bovine TB cases at slaughter may facilitate successful traceback investigations; however, they do not guarantee it. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide valuable information with regard to epidemiological traceback investigations and serve as a baseline to aid U.S. officials when assessing the impact of newly implemented strategies as part  of the national bovine TB eradication in the U.S.},

	Abstract = {Infectious disease ecology has recently raised its public profile beyond the scientific community due to the major threats that wildlife infections pose to biological conservation, animal welfare, human health and food security. As we start unravelling the full extent of emerging infectious diseases, there is an urgent need to facilitate multidisciplinary research in this area. Even though research in ecology has always had a strong theoretical component, cultural and technical hurdles often hamper direct collaboration between theoreticians and empiricists. Building upon our collective experience of multidisciplinary research and teaching in this area, we propose practical guidelines to help with  effective integration among mathematical modelling, fieldwork and laboratory work. Modelling tools can be used at all steps of a field-based research programme, from the formulation of working hypotheses to field study design and data analysis. We illustrate our model-guided fieldwork framework with two case studies we have been conducting on wildlife infectious diseases: plague transmission in prairie dogs and lyssavirus dynamics in American and African bats. These demonstrate that mechanistic models, if properly integrated in research programmes, can provide a framework for holistic approaches to complex biological systems.},

@article{lebreton_modeling_1992,
	Abstract = {The understanding of the dynamics of animal populations and of related ecological and evolutionary issues frequently depends on a direct analysis of life history parameters. For instance, examination of trade-offs between reproduction and survival usually rely on individually marked animals, for which the exact time of death is most often unknown, because marked individuals cannot be followed closely through time. Thus, the quantitative analysis of survival studies and experiments must be based on capture-recapture (or resighting) models which consider, besides the parameters of primary interest, recapture or resighting rates that are nuisance parameters. Capture-recapture models oriented to estimation of survival rates are the result of a recent change in emphasis from earlier approaches in which population size was the most important parameter, survival rates having been first introduced as nuisance parameters. This emphasis on survival rates in capture-recapture models developed rapidly in the 1980s and used as a basic structure the Cormack-Jolly-Seber survival model applied to an homogeneous group of animals, with various kinds of constraints on the model parameters. These approaches are conditional on first captures; hence they do not attempt to model the initial capture of unmarked animals as functions of population abundance in addition to survival and capture probabilities. This paper synthesizes, using a common framework, these recent developments together with new ones, with an emphasis on flexibility in modeling, model selection, and the analysis of multiple data sets. The effects on survival and capture rates of time, age, and categorical variables characterizing the individuals (e.g., sex) can be considered, as well as interactions between such effects. This "analysis of variance" philosophy emphasizes the structure of the survival and capture process rather than the technical characteristics of any particular model. The flexible array of models encompassed in this synthesis uses a common notation. As a result of the great level of flexibility and relevance achieved, the focus is changed from fitting a particular model to model building and model selection. The following procedure is recommended: (1) start from a global model compatible with the biology of the species studied and with the design of the study, and assess its fit; (2) select a more parsimonious model using Akaike's Information Criterion to limit the number of formal tests; (3) test for the most important biological questions by comparing this model with neighboring ones using likelihood ratio tests; and (4) obtain maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters with estimates of precision. Computer software is critical, as few of the models now available have parameter estimators that are in closed form. A comprehensive table of existing computer software is provided. We used RELEASE for data summary and goodness-of-fit tests and SURGE for iterative model fitting and the computation of likelihood ratio tests. Five increasingly complex examples are given to illustrate the theory. The first, using two data sets on the European Dipper (Cinclus cinclus), tests for sex-specific parameters, explores a model with time-dependent survival rates, and finally uses a priori information to model survival allowing for an environmental variable. The second uses data on two colonies of the Swift (Apus apus), and shows how interaction terms can be modeled and assessed and how survival and recapture rates sometimes partly counterbalance each other. The third shows complex variation in survival rates across sexes and age classes in the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), with a test of density dependence in annual survival rates. The fourth is an example of experimental density manipulation using the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara). The last example attempts to examine a large and complex data set on the Greater Flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber), where parameters are age specific, survival is a function of an environmental variable, and an age x year interaction term is important. Heterogeneity seems present in this example and cannot be adequately modeled with existing theory. The discussion presents a summary of the paradigm we recommend and details issues in model selection and design, and foreseeable future developments.},

	Abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is caused by Mycobacterium bovis. The disease has a long latent period, heterogenous spread, can infect many species and can persist  in the environment. In the UK, the rate of herd breakdowns (HBD) with bTB is increasing. A retrospective cohort study of 148 cattle herds was set up to investigate risk factors for HBD from October 2001 to November 2004. Herds were selected from farms located in the randomised badger culling trial (RBCT) and comprised holdings (24\%) that were restocked with cattle after the foot and mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in 2001 and holdings (76\%) that were continuously stocked  throughout the FMD epidemic. Farmers were interviewed between June 2003 and February 2004. Questions on herd and farm management were asked for the period October 2001 to June 2003. Data on herd testing for bTB were sourced from the VetNet database and historic data from 1995 were used in the analysis. A discrete time survival analysis was used to examine factors associated with the risk of HBD. By the end of the study period, November 2004, 50\% of study herds had experienced a HBD with bTB at least once. Farms that were restocked for less than 1 year after FMD had a reduced risk of HBD (P{\textless}0.01) compared with continuously stocked farms in the same year. This reduced risk did not persist after 1 year of restocking. Feeding vitamin and mineral lick supplements compared with not feeding these supplements also reduced the risk of HBD. Factors associated with an increased risk of HBD were storing manure and slurry indoors or in a closed container, spreading manure all year round, herds with dairy cattle compared with herds without dairy cattle, increasing herd size, purchase of cattle from markets, location of the farm in the proactive area of the RBCT compared with survey only and location of farms in Somerset and North Devon. The lower risk of  HBD in the first year after restocking but not the second or third year suggests  that removal of all cattle might have lowered the infectious load of M. bovis on  these premises for a period of time but that this did not persist once cattle were reintroduced. Purchase of cattle from markets suggests that there was a risk of introduction or re-introduction of bTB from these cattle. Method of storage or lack of storage of slurry might aid persistence of M. bovis in the environment if M. bovis survives in slurry in some circumstances.},

@article{ladeau_data-model_2011,
	Abstract = {Ecologists worldwide are challenged to contribute solutions to urgent and pressing environmental problems by forecasting how populations, communities, and ecosystems will respond to global change. Rising to this challenge requires organizing ecological information derived from diverse sources and formally assimilating data with models of ecological processes. The study of infectious disease has depended on strategies for integrating patterns of observed disease incidence with mechanistic process models since John Snow first mapped cholera cases around a London water pump in 1854. Still, zoonotic and vector-borne diseases increasingly affect human populations, and methods used to successfully characterize directly transmitted diseases are often insufficient. We use four case studies to demonstrate that advances in disease forecasting require better understanding of zoonotic host and vector populations, as well of the dynamics that facilitate pathogen amplification and disease spillover into humans. In each case study, this goal is complicated by limited data, spatiotemporal variability in pathogen transmission and impact, and often, insufficient biological understanding. We present a conceptual framework for data-model fusion in infectious disease research that addresses these fundamental challenges using a hierarchical state-space structure to (1) integrate multiple data sources and spatial scales to inform latent parameters, (2) partition uncertainty in process and observation models, and (3) explicitly build upon existing ecological and epidemiological understanding. Given the constraints inherent in the study of infectious disease and the urgent need for progress, fusion of data and expertise via this type of conceptual framework should prove an indispensable tool.},

There is, however, a general absence of knowledge about how far into the future, or other dimensions (space, temperature, phylogenetic distance), useful ecological forecasts can be made, and about how features of ecological systems relate to these distances. The ecological forecast horizon is the dimensional distance for which useful forecasts can be made. Five case studies illustrate the influence of various sources of uncertainty (e.g. parameter uncertainty, environmental variation, demographic stochasticity and evolution), level of ecological organisation (e.g. population or community), and organismal properties (e.g. body size or number of trophic links) on temporal, spatial and phylogenetic forecast horizons. Insights from these case studies demonstrate that the ecological forecast horizon is a flexible and powerful tool for researching and communicating ecological predictability. It also has potential for motivating and guiding agenda setting for ecological forecasting research and development.},

	Abstract = {Concern about the ecological consequences of global change has increasingly stimulated ecologists to examine the futures of ecological systems. Studying futures is not only a crucial element of the interaction between science, management and decision making, but also a critical research challenge per se, especially because futures cannot be observed or experimented on. In addition, researchers can encounter methodological and theoretical difficulties, which make interpretations and predictions problematic. In the literature which deals with futures of ecological systems two main lines of research can be distinguished: a  predictive approach, which dominates the literature, can be contrasted with a rarer number of studies that elaborate potential scenarios for ecological systems. Scenario approaches currently concern mainly contacts with stakeholders  or decision makers, or the use of climate scenarios to derive projections about ecological futures. We argue that a new direction for ecological futures research could be explored by using ecological scenarios in combination with predictive models to further fundamental ecological research, in addition to enhancing its applied value.},

	Abstract = {Traditionally, state-space models are fitted to data where there is uncertainty in the observation or measurement of the system. State-space models are partitioned into an underlying system process describing the transitions of the true states of the system over time and the observation process linking the observations of the system to the true states. Open population capture--recapture--recovery data can be modelled in this framework by regarding the system process as the state of each individual observed within the study in terms of being alive or dead, and the observation process the recapture and/or recovery process. The traditional observation error of a state-space model is incorporated via the recapture/recovery probabilities being less than unity. The models can be fitted using a Bayesian data augmentation approach and in standard BUGS packages. Applying this state-space framework to such data permits additional complexities including individual heterogeneity to be fitted to the data at very little additional programming effort. We consider the efficiency of the state-space model fitting approach by considering a random effects model for capture--recapture data relating to dippers and compare different Bayesian model-fitting algorithms within WinBUGS.},

	Abstract = {Interpretation of regression coefficients is sensitive to the scale of the inputs. One method often used to place input variables on a common scale is to divide each numeric variable by its standard deviation. Here we propose dividing each numeric variable by two times its standard deviation, so that the generic comparison is with inputs equal to the mean +/- 1 standard deviation. The resulting coefficients are then directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two simple analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data from the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data on the prevalence of rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our resealing as a default option-an improvement upon the usual approach of including variables in whatever way they are coded in the data file-so that the magnitudes of coefficients can be directly compared as a matter of routine statistical practice.

@article{menzies_cattle--cattle_2000,
	Abstract = {In developed countries, Mycobacterium bovis infection in cattle is now mostly confined to the respiratory system, which reflects transmission and establishment of infection mainly by this route. A single bacillus transported within a droplet nucleus is probably sufficient to establish, infection within the bovine lung. Infected cattle should always be considered as potential sources of infection, since studies have demonstrated that a significant proportion of tuberculous cattle excrete M. bovis. In general, the dynamics of M. bovis transmission are poorly understood and the conditions under which a tuberculous animal becomes an effective disseminator of infection are currently not defined although environmental contamination appears to be a less effective method of disease transmission. Field studies indicate a wide spectrum of transmission rates but generally the spread of M. bovis infection is still considered to be a relatively slow process. Slaughter of diseased cattle detected by tuberculin testing and at meat plant inspection has been shown to be an effective policy for tuberculosis eradication, provided there are no other reservoirs of infection and all involved in the cattle industry are committed to a policy of eradication. Epidemiological approaches, particularly case-control studies, seem to provide the best method for quantifying the relative importance of the various sources of M bovis transmission to cattle and modelling techniques can be used to assist in the design of cost-effective control measures that may lead to tuberculosis eradication.

"Matt Keeling and Pejman Rohani move from modeling with simple differential equations to more recent, complex models, where spacial structure, seasonal "forcing," or stochasticity influence the dynamics, and where computer simulation needs to be used to generate theory. In each of the eight chapters, they deal with a specific modeling approach or set of techniques designed to capture a particular biological factor. The illustrate the methodology used with examples from recent research literature on human and infectious disease modeling, showing how such techniques can be used in practice. Diseases considered include BSE, foot-and-mouth, HIV, measles, rubella, smallpox, and West Nile virus, among others. Particular attention is given throughout the book to the development of practical models, useful both as predictive tools and as a means to understand fundamental epidemiological processes.

	Abstract = {A precise definition of the basic reproduction number, R0, is presented for a general compartmental disease transmission model based on a system of ordinary differential equations. It is shown that, if R0\&lt;1, then the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable; whereas if R0\&gt;1, then it is unstable. Thus, R0 is a threshold parameter for the model. An analysis of the local centre manifold yields a simple criterion for the existence and stability of super- and sub-threshold endemic equilibria for R0 near one. This criterion, together with the definition of R0, is illustrated by treatment, multigroup, staged progression, multistrain and vector--host models and can be applied to more complex models. The results are significant for disease control.},

	Abstract = {The basic reproductive ratio, R0, is defined as the expected number of secondary infections arising from a single individual during his or her entire infectious period, in a population of susceptibles. This concept is fundamental to the study of epidemiology and within-host pathogen dynamics. Most importantly, R0 often serves as a threshold parameter that predicts whether an infection will spread. Related parameters which share this threshold behaviour, however, may or may not give the true value of R0. In this paper we give a brief overview of common methods of formulating R0 and surrogate threshold parameters from deterministic, non-structured models. We also review common means of estimating R0 from epidemiological data. Finally, we survey the recent use of R0 in assessing emerging diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, a number of recent livestock diseases, and vector-borne diseases malaria, dengue and West Nile virus},

This sampling approach allows the user to exclusively choose samples from subpopulations that have a higher likelihood of the disease of interest. This is achieved by selecting animals from a subpopulation that exhibits some characteristic that indicates a higher probability of the presence of the disease. Inferences drawn from a targeted sample require information regarding the epidemiology of the disease under surveillance, which is generally not known with certainty. This study describes estimators for both the detection of disease and the estimation of prevalence when targeted sampling is employed. Modifications of these estimators are provided that account for the uncertainty in the parameters that describe the epidemiology of the disease.

	Abstract = {Migratory behavior of waterfowl populations in North America has traditionally been broadly characterized by four north--south flyways, and these flyways have been central to the management of waterfowl populations for more than 80 yr. However, previous flyway characterizations are not easily updated with current bird movement data and fail to provide assessments of the importance of specific geographical regions to the identification of flyways. Here, we developed a network model of migratory movement for four waterfowl species, Mallard (Anas platyrhnchos), Northern Pintail (A. acuta), American Green-winged Teal (A. carolinensis), and Canada Goose (Branta canadensis), in North America, using bird band and recovery data. We then identified migratory flyways using a community detection algorithm and characterized the importance of smaller geographic regions in identifying flyways using a novel metric, the consolidation factor. We identified four main flyways for Mallards, Northern Pintails, and American Green-winged Teal, with the flyway identification in Canada Geese exhibiting higher complexity. For Mallards, flyways were relatively consistent through time. However, consolidation factors revealed that for Mallards and Green-winged Teal, the presumptive Mississippi flyway was potentially a zone of high mixing between other flyways. Our results demonstrate that the network approach provides a robust method for flyway identification that is widely applicable given the relatively minimal data requirements and is easily updated with future movement data to reflect changes in flyway definitions and management goals.},

@article{ebel_estimating_2008,
	Abstract = {Making valid inferences about herd prevalence from data collected at slaughter is difficult because the observed sample is dependent on the number of animals sampled from each herd, which varies with herd size and culling practices, and the probability of a positive test result, which depends on variable within-herd prevalence levels as well as test sensitivity and specificity. In this study, brucellosis herd prevalence among beef cow-calf operations is estimated from slaughter surveillance data using a method that combines process modeling with Bayesian inference. Inferences are made for two populations; the first population comprises cow-calf beef herds in a typical U.S. state. The second population represents all beef herds in a collection of 46 low-risk states. The Bayesian Monte Carlo method used in this study links process model inputs to observed surveillance results via Bayes Theorem. The surveillance evidence across multiple years is accumulated at a discounted rate based on the probability of introducing new infection into an area. The process model's inputs include herd size, culling rate per herd, within-herd prevalence, serologic test performance, and the probability of successfully investigating positive results. The surveillance results comprise the number of cows and bulls tested at slaughter and the number of affected herds detected each year. The results find at least 95\% confidence that brucellosis herd prevalence among beef cow-calf herds is less than 0.014\% (3 per 21,500 herds) and 0.00081\% (5 per 6,15,770) after 5 years of slaughter surveillance (with no detections of affected herds) in a typical U.S. state and across 46 low-risk U.S. states, respectively. These results were based on conservative modeling assumptions, but sensitivity analysis suggests only slight changes in the results from changing the assumed process model input values. The most influential analytic input was the probability of introducing new infection into a putatively brucellosis-free state or group of states},

	Abstract = {The tools we use to investigate infectious diseases tend to focus on specific one-host--one-pathogen relationships, but pathogens often have complex life cycles involving many hosts. Johnson et al. review how such complexity is analyzed by community ecologists. Ecologists have the investigative tools to probe cause and effect relationships that change with spatial scale in multispecies communities. These techniques are used to monitor the ways in which communities change through time and to probe the heterogeneity that characterizes individuals, species, and assemblages---all issues that are also essential for disease specialists to understand.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1259504BACKGROUNDDespite ongoing advances in biomedicine, infectious diseases remain a major threat to human health, economic sustainability, and wildlife conservation. This is in part a result of the challenges of controlling widespread or persistent infections that involve multiple hosts, vectors, and parasite species. Moreover, many contemporary disease threats involve interactions that manifest across nested scales of biological organization, from disease progression at the within-host level to emergence and spread at the regional level. For many such infections, complete eradication is unlikely to be successful, but a broader understanding of the community in which host-parasite interactions are embedded will facilitate more effective management. Recent advances in community ecology, including findings from traits-based approaches and metacommunity theory, offer the tools and concepts to address the complexities arising from multispecies, multiscale disease threats.ADVANCESCommunity ecology aims to identify the factors that govern the structure, assembly, and dynamics of ecological communities. We describe how analytical and conceptual approaches from this discipline can be used to address fundamental challenges in disease research, such as (i) managing the ecological complexity of multihost-multiparasite assemblages; (ii) identifying the drivers of heterogeneities among individuals, species, and regions; and (iii) quantifying how processes link across multiple scales of biological organization to drive disease dynamics. We show how a community ecology framework can help to determine whether infection is best controlled through ``defensive'' approaches that reduce host suitability or through ``offensive'' approaches that dampen parasite spread. Examples of defensive approaches are the strategic use of wildlife diversity to reduce host and vector transmission, and taking advantage of antagonism between symbionts to suppress within-host growth and pathology. Offensive approaches include the targeted control of superspreading hosts and the reduction of human-wildlife contact rates to mitigate spillover. By identifying the importance of parasite dispersal and establishment, a community ecology framework can offer additional insights about the scale at which disease should be controlled.OUTLOOKOngoing technological advances are rapidly overcoming previous barriers in data quality and quantity for complex, multispecies systems. The emerging synthesis of ``disease community ecology'' offers the tools and concepts necessary to interpret these data and use that understanding to inform the development of more effective disease control strategies in humans and wildlife. Looking forward, we emphasize the increasing importance of tight integration among surveillance, community ecology analyses, and public health implementation. Building from the rich legacy of whole-system manipulations in community ecology, we further highlight the value of large-scale experiments for understanding host-pathogen interactions and designing effective control measures. Through this blending of data, theory, and analytical approaches, we can understand how interactions between parasites within hosts, hosts within populations, and host species within ecological communities combine to drive disease dynamics, thereby providing new ways to manage emerging infections.The community ecology of disease.(A) Interactions between parasites can complicate management. Among Tsimane villagers, treatment of hookworms increases infections by Giardia lamblia. (B) Similarly, understanding how ecological communities of hosts assemble can help forecast changes in disease. Biodiversity losses can promote interactions between white-footed mice and deer ticks, leading to an increase in the risk of Lyme disease from Borrelia burgdorferi.[Credits: (A) A. Pisor, CDC, F. Dubs; (B) J. Brunner, T. Shears, NIH]Infectious diseases often emerge from interactions among multiple species and across nested levels of biological organization. Threats as diverse as Ebola virus, human malaria, and bat white-nose syndrome illustrate the need for a mechanistic understanding of the ecological interactions underlying emerging infections. We describe how recent advances in community ecology can be adopted to address contemporary challenges in disease research. These analytical tools can identify the factors governing complex assemblages of multiple hosts, parasites, and vectors, and reveal how processes link across scales from individual hosts to regions. They can also determine the drivers of heterogeneities among individuals, species, and regions to aid targeting of control strategies. We provide examples where these principles have enhanced disease management and illustrate how they can be further extended.},

Theory predicts co-infections to have major consequences for both within- and between-host disease dynamics, but data are currently scarce. Here, using common garden populations of Plantago lanceolata infected by two strains of the pathogen Podosphaera plantaginis, either singly or under co-infection, we find the highest disease prevalence in co-infected treatments both at the host genotype and population levels. A spore-trapping experiment demonstrates that co-infected hosts shed more transmission propagules than singly infected hosts, thereby explaining the observed change in epidemiological dynamics. Our experimental findings are confirmed in natural pathogen populations---more devastating epidemics were measured in populations with higher levels of co-infection. Jointly, our results confirm the predictions made by theoretical and experimental studies for the potential of co-infection to alter disease dynamics across a large host--pathogen metapopulation.},

	Abstract = {The ubiquity and importance of parasite co-infections in populations of free-living animals is beginning to be recognized, but few studies have demonstrated differential fitness effects of single infection versus co-infection in free-living populations. We investigated interactions between the emerging bacterial disease bovine tuberculosis (BTB) and the previously existing viral disease Rift Valley fever (RVF) in a competent reservoir host, African buffalo, combining data from a natural outbreak of RVF in captive buffalo at a buffalo breeding facility in 2008 with data collected from a neighbouring free-living herd of African buffalo in Kruger National Park. RVF infection was twice as likely in individual BTB+ buffalo as in BTB− buffalo, which, according to a mathematical model, may increase RVF outbreak size at the population level. In addition, co-infection was associated with a far higher rate of fetal abortion than other infection states. Immune interactions between BTB and RVF may underlie both of these interactions, since animals with BTB had decreased innate immunity and increased pro-inflammatory immune responses. This study is one of the first to demonstrate how the consequences of emerging infections extend beyond direct effects on host health, potentially altering the dynamics and fitness effects of infectious diseases that had previously existed in the ecosystem on free-ranging wildlife populations.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
Co-infection of individual hosts by multiple parasite species is a pattern that is very commonly observed in natural populations. Understanding the processes that generate these patterns poses a challenge. For example, it is difficult to discern the relative roles of exposure and susceptibility in generating the mixture and density of parasites within hosts. Yet discern them we must, if we are to design and deliver successful medical interventions for co-infected populations. Here, we synthesise an emergent understanding of how processes operate and interact to generate patterns of co-infection. We consider within-host communities (or infracommunities) generally, that is including not only classical parasites but also the microbiota that are so abundant on mucosal surfaces and which are increasingly understood to be so influential on host biology. We focus on communities that include a helminth, but we expect similar inferences to pertain to other taxa. We suggest that, thanks to recent research at both the within-host (e.g. immunological) and between-host (e.g. epidemiological) scales, researchers are poised to reveal the processes that generate the observed distribution of parasite communities among hosts. Progress will be facilitated by using new technologies as well as statistical and experimental tools to test competing hypotheses about processes that might generate patterns in co-infection data. By understanding the multiple interactions that underlie patterns of co-infection, we will be able to understand and intelligently predict how a suite of co-infections (and thus the host that bears them) will together respond to medical interventions as well as other environmental changes. The challenge for us all is to become scholars of co-infections.},

	Abstract = {Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium bovis, was first diagnosed in African buffalo in South Africa's Kruger National Park in 1990. Over the past 15 years the disease has spread northwards leaving only the most northern buffalo herds unaffected. Evidence suggests that 10 other small and large mammalian species, including large predators, are spillover hosts. Wildlife tuberculosis has also been diagnosed in several adjacent private game reserves and in the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, the third largest game reserve in South Africa.

The tuberculosis epidemic has a number of implications, for which the full effect of some might only be seen in the long-term. Potential negative long-term effects on the population dynamics of certain social animal species and the direct threat for the survival of endangered species pose particular problems for wildlife conservationists. On the other hand, the risk of spillover infection to neighboring communal cattle raises concerns about human health at the wildlife--livestock--human interface, not only along the western boundary of Kruger National Park, but also with regards to the joint development of the Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Area with Zimbabwe and Mozambique. From an economic point of view, wildlife tuberculosis has resulted in national and international trade restrictions for affected species. The lack of diagnostic tools for most species and the absence of an effective vaccine make it currently impossible to contain and control this disease within an infected free-ranging ecosystem. Veterinary researchers and policy-makers have recognized the need to intensify research on this disease and the need to develop tools for control, initially targeting buffalo and lion.},

This article reviews the main risk factors for bTB in cattle based on a three-level classification: animal, herd and region/country level. A distinction is also made, whenever possible, between situations in developed and developing countries as the difference of context might have consequences in terms of risk of bTB. Recommendations are suggested to animal health professionals and scientists directly involved in the control and prevention of bTB in cattle. The determination of Millenium Development Goals for bTB is proposed to improve the control/eradication of the disease worldwide.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
Despite control and eradication efforts, bovine tuberculosis continues to be identified at low levels among cattle in the United States. We evaluated possible external sources of infection by characterizing the genetic relatedness of bovine tuberculosis from a national database of reported infections, comparing strains circulating among US cattle with those of imported cattle, and farmed and wild cervids.

Farmed cervids maintained a genetically distinct Mycobacterium bovis strain, and cattle occasionally became infected with this strain. In contrast, wild cervids acted as an epidemiologically distinct group, instead hosting many of the same strains found in cattle, and the data did not show a clear transmission direction. Cattle from Mexico hosted a higher overall richness of strains than US cattle, and many of those strains were found in both US and Mexican cattle. However, these two populations appeared to be well-mixed with respect to their M. bovis lineages, and higher resolution data is necessary to infer the direction of recent transmission.

Overall patterns of both host and geographic distributions were highly variable among strains, suggesting that different sources or transmission mechanisms are contributing to maintaining different strains.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
From 2002 to 2013, bovine tuberculosis (bTB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) has been detected on numerous dairies in California. In total, twelve herds had bTB detected and are included in the case series which describes these recent outbreaks and discusses potential pathways of introduction. Epidemiological investigations to determine the initial source of bTB in each herd included obtaining data on likely pathways of pathogen introduction. Pathways included purchasing cattle, use of heifer-raising operations, commingling of cattle at greater risk of exposure to infected cattle with cattle destined for California dairies, contact with infected wildlife, exposure to humans with bTB infections, community and neighboring herds and others. Epidemiologic and molecular typing data confirmed the source of infection in 3 herds and probable sources of infection in 2 herds. In the 7 remaining herds described in this case series an epidemiologic link to a source could not be determined and molecular typing results did not associate M. bovis isolates acquired from these herds with another specific U.S. herd or U.S.-born animal. Preventing new introductions of M. bovis onto California dairies will require rigorous epidemiologic investigation of all the potential pathways of introduction discussed here. The root cause(s) of bTB on California dairies is certainly multifactorial with complex interactions of herd management practices, importation of cattle at greater risk of exposure to infected cattle, and the potential of human M. bovis exposure. The extensive use of molecular typing has improved epidemiologists' ability to narrow the scope of potential sources.},

@article{dibble_waiting_2016,
	Abstract = {Emerging diseases must make a transition from stuttering chains of transmission to sustained chains of transmission, but this critical transition need not coincide with the system becoming supercritical. That is, the introduction of infection to a supercritical system results in a significant fraction of the population becoming infected only with a certain probability. Understanding the waiting time to the first major outbreak of an emerging disease is then more complicated than determining when the system becomes supercritical. We treat emergence as a dynamic bifurcation, and use the concept of bifurcation delay to understand the time to emergence after a system becomes supercritical. Specifically, we consider an SIR model with a time-varying transmission term and random infections originating from outside the population. We derive an analytic density function for the delay times and find it to be, in general, in agreement with stochastic simulations. We find the key parameters to be the rate of introduction of infection and the rate of change of the basic reproductive ratio. These findings aid our understanding of real emergence events, and can be incorporated into early-warning systems aimed at forecasting disease risk.},

@article{hobbs_state-space_2015,
	Abstract = {The bison (Bison bison) of the Yellowstone ecosystem, USA, exemplify the difficulty of conserving large mammals that migrate across the boundaries of conservation areas. Bison are infected with brucellosis (Brucella abortus) and their seasonal movements can expose livestock to infection. Yellowstone National Park has embarked on a program of adaptive management of bison, which requires a model that assimilates data to support management decisions. We constructed a Bayesian state-space model to reveal the influence of brucellosis on the Yellowstone bison population. A frequency-dependent model of brucellosis transmission was superior to a density-dependent model in predicting out-of-sample observations of horizontal transmission probability. A mixture model including both transmission mechanisms converged on frequency dependence. Conditional on the frequency-dependent model, brucellosis median transmission rate was 1.87 yr−1. The median of the posterior distribution of the basic reproductive ratio (R0) was 1.75. Seroprevalence of adult females varied around 60\% over two decades, but only 9.6 of 100 adult females were infectious. Brucellosis depressed recruitment; estimated population growth rate λ averaged 1.07 for an infected population and 1.11 for a healthy population. We used five-year forecasting to evaluate the ability of different actions to meet management goals relative to no action. Annually removing 200 seropositive female bison increased by 30-fold the probability of reducing seroprevalence below 40\% and increased by a factor of 120 the probability of achieving a 50\% reduction in transmission probability relative to no action. Annually vaccinating 200 seronegative animals increased the likelihood of a 50\% reduction in transmission probability by fivefold over no action. However, including uncertainty in the ability to implement management by representing stochastic variation in the number of accessible bison dramatically reduced the probability of achieving goals using interventions relative to no action. Because the width of the posterior predictive distributions of future population states expands rapidly with increases in the forecast horizon, managers must accept high levels of uncertainty. These findings emphasize the necessity of iterative, adaptive management with relatively short-term commitment to action and frequent reevaluation in response to new data and model forecasts. We believe our approach has broad applications.},

	Abstract = {I examined associations between several components of host social organization, including group size and gregariousness, group stability, territoriality and social class, and gastrointestinal parasite load in African bovids. At an intraspecific level, group size was positively correlated with parasite prevalence, but only when the parasite was relatively host specific and only among host species living in stable groups. Social class was also an important predictor of infection rates. Among gazelles, territorial males had higher parasite intensities than did either bachelor males or females and juveniles, suggesting that highly territorial individuals may be either more exposed or more susceptible to parasites. Associations among territoriality, grouping, and parasitism were also found across taxa. Territorial host genera were more likely to be infected with strongyle nematodes than were nonterritorial hosts, and gregarious hosts were more infected than were solitary hosts. Analyses also revealed that gregariousness and territoriality had an interactive effect on individual parasite richness, whereby hosts with both traits harbored significantly more parasite groups than did hosts with only one or neither trait. Overall, study results indicate that multiple features of host social behavior influence infection risk and suggest that synergism between traits also has important effects on host parasite load.},

	Abstract = {SummaryBackground
The epidemics of HIV-1 and tuberculosis in South Africa are closely related. High mortality rates in co-infected patients have improved with antiretroviral therapy, but drug-resistant tuberculosis has emerged as a major cause of death. We assessed the prevalence and consequences of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis in a rural area in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa.
Methods
We undertook enhanced surveillance for drug-resistant tuberculosis with sputum culture and drug susceptibility testing in patients with known or suspected tuberculosis. Genotyping was done for isolates resistant to first-line and second-line drugs.
Results
From January, 2005, to March, 2006, sputum was obtained from 1539 patients. We detected MDR tuberculosis in 221 patients, of whom 53 had XDR tuberculosis. Prevalence among 475 patients with culture-confirmed tuberculosis was 39\% (185 patients) for MDR and 6\% (30) for XDR tuberculosis. Only 55\% (26 of 47) of patients with XDR tuberculosis had never been previously treated for tuberculosis; 67\% (28 of 42) had a recent hospital admission. All 44 patients with XDR tuberculosis who were tested for HIV were co-infected. 52 of 53 patients with XDR tuberculosis died, with median survival of 16 days from time of diagnosis (IQR 6--37) among the 42 patients with confirmed dates of death. Genotyping of isolates showed that 39 of 46 (85\%, 95\% CI 74--95) patients with XDR tuberculosis had similar strains.
Conclusions
MDR tuberculosis is more prevalent than previously realised in this setting. XDR tuberculosis has been transmitted to HIV co-infected patients and is associated with high mortality. These observations warrant urgent intervention and threaten the success of treatment programmes for tuberculosis and HIV.},

In equatorial Africa, outbreaks of RVF are associated with high rainfall, when vector populations are at their highest. It is, however, unclear how RVF virus persists during the inter-epidemic periods and between seasons. Understanding inter-epidemic persistence as well as the role of vectors and hosts is paramount to creating effective management programmes for RVF control. We created a mathematical model for the spread of RVF and used the model to explore different scenarios of persistence including vertical transmission and alternate wildlife hosts, with a case study on buffalo in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Our results suggest that RVF persistence is a delicate balance between numerous species of susceptible hosts, mosquito species, vertical transmission and environmental stochasticity. Further investigations should not focus on a single species, but should instead consider a myriad of susceptible host species when seeking to understand disease dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Most population models incorporate density dependence in a manner that implies the effects of density set in at increasingly higher rates as population densities decrease to zero. For many populations, it may be more plausible to assume that the effects of density set in at a maximum rate around some characteristic density \$K {\textgreater} 0\$: that is, the per capita rate of increase of the population has an inverted sigmoidal form as a function of population density. In the model discussed here, the rate at which density dependence sets in around K is governed by a parameter \&\#x3b3;, which I refer to as the "abruptness" parameter: the larger the parameter \&\#x3b3;, the weaker the effects of density dependence are for population densities below K, the more rapidly density dependence sets in around K, and the more severe the effects of density dependence are beyond K. Results obtained from an Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) analysis of the abruptness parameter \&\#x3b3; suggest the hypothesis that populations with a density-independent growth rate of \${\textless}\$100\% from one generation to the next (i.e., a reproductive value of \${\textless}\$2) will exhibit a relatively high level of abruptness in their response to density, while the reverse will be true for populations with a density-independent growth rate of \${\textgreater}\$100\%. Further, if true, this hypothesis suggests that females with high reproductive rates who deposit young on resources and provide no further maternal care should clump their young to reduce the level of abruptness in density dependence. Also, this hypothesis, together with the fact that high levels of abruptness promote oscillations in populations, implies that we are more likely to observe cyclic and chaotic behavior in relatively slower growing populations than previously thought.},

	Abstract = {Chikungunya and dengue are re-emerging mosquito-borne infectious diseases that are of increasing concern as human travel and expanding mosquito ranges increase the risk of spread. We seek to understand the differences in transient and endemic behavior of chikungunya and dengue; risk of emergence for different virus-vector assemblages; and the role that virus evolution plays in disease dynamics and risk. To address these questions, we adapt a mathematical mosquito-borne disease model to chikungunya and dengue in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. We derive analytical threshold conditions and important dimensionless parameters for virus transmission; perform sensitivity analysis on quantities of interest such as the basic reproduction number, endemic equilibrium, and first epidemic peak; and compute distributions for the quantities of interest across parameter ranges. We found that chikungunya and dengue exhibit different transient dynamics and long-term endemic levels. While the order of most sensitive parameters is preserved across vector-virus combinations, the magnitude of sensitivity is different across scenarios, indicating that risk of invasion or an outbreak can change with vector-virus assemblages. We found that the dengue - A. aegypti and new Reunion strain of chikungunya - A. albopictus systems represent the highest risk across the range of parameters considered. These results inform future experimental and field research efforts and point toward effective mitigation strategies adapted to each disease. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Co-infections by multiple pathogen strains are common in the wild. Theory predicts co-infections to have major consequences for both within- and between-host disease dynamics, but data are currently scarce. Here, using common  garden populations of Plantago lanceolata infected by two strains of the pathogen Podosphaera plantaginis, either singly or under co-infection, we find the highest disease prevalence in co-infected treatments both at the host genotype and population levels. A spore-trapping experiment demonstrates that co-infected hosts shed more transmission propagules than singly infected hosts, thereby explaining the observed change in epidemiological dynamics. Our experimental findings are confirmed in natural pathogen populations-more devastating epidemics were measured in populations with higher levels of co-infection. Jointly, our results confirm the predictions made by theoretical and experimental studies for  the potential of co-infection to alter disease dynamics across a large host-pathogen metapopulation.},

@article{courchamp_dynamics_1997,
	Abstract = {We present a deterministic model of the dynamics of two microparasites simultaneously infecting a single host population. Both microparasites are feline retroviruses, namely Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukaemia Virus (FeLV). The host is the domestic cat Felis catus. The model has been tested with data generated by a long--term study of several natural cat populations. Stability analysis and simulations show that, once introduced in a population, FIV spreads and is maintained, while FeLV can either disappear or persist. Moreover, introduction of both viruses into the population induces an equilibrium state for individuals of each different pathological class. The viruses never induce the extinction of the population. Furthermore, whatever the outcome for the host population (persistence of FIV only, or of both viruses), the global population size at the equilibrium state is only slightly lower than it would have been in the absence of the infections (i.e. at the carrying capacity), indicating a low impact of the viruses on the population. Finally, the impact of the diseases examined simultaneously is higher than the sum of the impact of the two diseases examined separately. This seems to be due to a higher mortality rate when both viruses infect a single individual.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients coinfected with Lyme disease and babesiosis in sites where both diseases are zoonotic experience a greater number  of symptoms for a longer period of time than those with either infection alone. DESIGN: Community-based, yearly serosurvey and clinic-based cohort study. SETTING: Island community in Rhode Island and 2 Connecticut medical clinics from  1990 to 1994. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Long-term residents of the island community and patients seeking treatment at the clinics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Seroreactivity  to the agents of Lyme disease and babesiosis and number and duration of symptoms. RESULTS: Of 1156 serosurvey subjects, 97 (8.4\%) were seroreactive against Lyme disease spirochete antigen, of whom 14 (14\%) also were seroreactive against babesial antigen. Of 240 patients diagnosed with Lyme disease, 26 (11\%) were coinfected with babesiosis. Coinfected patients experienced fatigue (P = .002), headache (P {\textless} .001), sweats (P {\textless} .001), chills (P = .03), anorexia (P = .04), emotional lability (P = .02), nausea (P = .004), conjunctivitis (P = .04), and splenomegaly (P = .01) more frequently than those with Lyme disease alone. Thirteen (50\%) of 26 coinfected patients were symptomatic for 3 months or longer  compared with 7 (4\%) of the 184 patients with Lyme disease alone from whom follow-up data were available (P {\textless} .001). Patients coinfected with Lyme disease experienced more symptoms and a more persistent episode of illness than did those (n = 10) experiencing babesial infection alone. Circulating spirochetal DNA was detected more than 3 times as often in coinfected patients as in those with Lyme  disease alone (P = .06). CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 10\% of patients with Lyme disease in southern New England are coinfected with babesiosis in sites where both diseases are zoonotic. The number of symptoms and duration of illness in patients with concurrent Lyme disease and babesiosis are greater than in patients with either infection alone. In areas where both Lyme disease and babesiosis have been reported, the possibility of concomitant babesial infection should be considered when moderate to severe Lyme disease has been diagnosed.},

	Abstract = {Co-infection is ubiquitous in people in the developing world but little is known regarding the potential for one parasite to act as a risk factor for another. Using generalized linear mixed modelling approaches applied to data from school-aged children from Zanzibar, Tanzania, we determined the strength of association between four focal infections (i.e. Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, hookworm and self-reported fever, the latter used as a proxy for viral, bacterial or protozoal infections) and the prevalence or intensity of each of the helminth infections. We compared these potential co-infections with additional risk factors, specifically, host sex and age, socioeconomic status and physical environment, and determined what the relative contribution of each risk factor was. We found that the risk of infection with all four focal infections was strongly associated with at least one other infection, and that this was frequently dependent on the intensity of that other infection. In comparison, no other incorporated risk factor was associated with all focal infections. Successful control of infectious diseases requires identification of infection risk factors. This study demonstrates that co-infection is likely to be one of these principal risk factors and should therefore be given greater consideration when designing disease-control strategies. Future work should also incorporate other potential risk factors, including host genetics which were not available in this study and, ideally, assess the risks via experimental manipulation},

@article{colijn_what_2010,
	Abstract = {The rise of antimicrobial resistance in many pathogens presents a major challenge to the treatment and control of infectious diseases. Furthermore, the observation that drug-resistant strains have risen to substantial prevalence but have not replaced drug-susceptible strains despite continuing (and even growing) selective pressure by antimicrobial use presents an important problem for those who study the dynamics of infectious diseases. While simple competition models predict the exclusion of one strain in favour of whichever is `fitter', or has a higher reproduction number, we argue that in the case of Streptococcus pneumoniae there has been persistent coexistence of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, with neither approaching 100 per cent prevalence. We have previously proposed that models seeking to understand the origins of coexistence should not incorporate implicit mechanisms that build in stable coexistence `for free'. Here, we construct a series of such `structurally neutral' models that incorporate various features of bacterial spread and host heterogeneity that have been proposed as mechanisms that may promote coexistence. We ask to what extent coexistence is a typical outcome in each. We find that while coexistence is possible in each of the models we consider, it is relatively rare, with two exceptions: (i) allowing simultaneous dual transmission of sensitive and resistant strains lets coexistence become a typical outcome, as does (ii) modelling each strain as competing more strongly with itself than with the other strain, i.e. self-immunity greater than cross-immunity. We conclude that while treatment and contact heterogeneity can promote coexistence to some extent, the in-host interactions between strains, particularly the interplay between coinfection, multiple infection and immunity, play a crucial role in the long-term population dynamics of pathogens with drug resistance. {\copyright} 2009 The Royal Society},

@article{martcheva_role_2006,
	Abstract = {We investigate an epidemic model of two diseases. The primary disease is assumed to be a slowly progressing disease, and the density of individuals infected with it is structured by age since infection. Hosts that are already infected with the primary disease can become coinfected with a secondary disease. We show that in addition to the disease-free equilibrium, there exists a unique dominance equilibrium corresponding to each disease. Without coinfection there are no coexistence equilibria; however, with coinfection the number of coexistence equilibria may vary. For some parameter values, there exist two coexistence equilibria. We also observe competitor-mediated oscillatory coexistence. Furthermore, weakly subthreshold ( which occur when exactly one of the reproduction numbers is below one) and strongly subthreshold ( which occur when both reproduction numbers are below one) coexistence equilibria may exist. Some of those are a result of a two-parameter backward bifurcation. Bistability occurs in several regions of the parameter space. Despite the presence of coinfection, coexistence of the two diseases appears possible only for relatively small values of the reproduction numbers-for large values of the reproduction numbers the typical outcome of competition is the dominance of one of the diseases, including bistable dominance where the competition outcome is initial condition dependent.},

	Abstract = {Brucellosis caused by Brucella spp. is a major zoonotic disease. Control of brucellosis in agricultural animals is a prerequisite for the prevention of this  disease in human beings. Recently, Brucella melitensis was declared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be one of three major bioterrorist  agents due to the expense required for the treatment of human brucellosis patients. Also, the economic agricultural loss due to bovine brucellosis emphasizes the financial impact of brucellosis in society. Thus, vaccination might efficiently solve this disease. Currently, B. abortus RB51 and B. melitensis REV.1 are used to immunize cattle and to immunize goats and sheep, respectively, in many countries. However, these genetically undefined strains still induce abortion and persistent infection, raising questions of safety and efficiency. In fact, the REV.1 vaccine is quite virulent and apparently unstable, creating the need for improved vaccines for B. melitensis. In addition, Brucella  spp. may or may not provide cross-protection against infection by heterologous Brucella species, hampering the acceleration of vaccine development. This review  provides our current understanding of Brucella pathogenesis and host immunity for the development of genetically defined efficient vaccine strains. Additionally, conditions required for an effective Brucella vaccine strain as well as the future research direction needed to investigate Brucella pathogenesis and host immunity are postulated.},

An interesting question is, when would we expect the interference effect to be pronounced? To address the issue, here we develop a seasonally forced two-disease age-structured model, using empirically derived age-specific force of infection (ASFOI) for numerous infections of childhood. Our comparative numerical analysis shows that when the ASFOIs for the two diseases largely overlap, the dynamics predicted by the two-disease model are generally different from those predicted by the analogous single-disease model, suggesting strong fingerprints of disease interference. When the ASFOIs overlap less, on the other hand, both diseases behave as predicted by the single-disease model, suggesting weak interference. We conclude that age structure is an important factor that should be taken into account in order to explore the underlying mechanisms of disease interference},

	Abstract = {Viral respiratory tract diseases pose serious public health problems. Our ability to predict and thus, be able to prepare for outbreaks is strained by the complex factors driving the prevalence and severity of these diseases. The abundance of diseases and transmission dynamics of strains are not only affected by external factors, such as weather, but also driven by interactions among viruses mediated by human behavior and immunity. To untangle the complex out-of-phase annual and biennial pattern of three common paramyxoviruses, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Human Parainfluenza Virus (HPIV), and Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), we adopt a theoretical approach that integrates ecological and immunological mechanisms of disease interactions. By estimating parameters from multiyear time series of laboratory-confirmed cases from the intermountain west region of the United States and using statistical inference, we show that models of immune-mediated interactions better explain the data than those based on ecological competition by convalescence. The strength of cross-protective immunity among viruses is correlated with their genetic distance in the phylogenetic tree of the paramyxovirus family},

@article{abu-raddad_impact_2004,
	Abstract = {We examine the dynamics of antigenically diverse infectious agents using a mathematical model describing the transmission dynamics of arbitrary numbers of pathogen strains, interacting via cross--immunity, and in the presence of mutations generating new strains and stochastic extinctions of existing ones. Equilibrium dynamics fall into three classes depending on cross--immunity, transmissibility and host population size: systems where global extinction is likely, stable single--strain persistence, and multiple--strain persistence with stable diversity. Where multi--strain dynamics are stable, a diversity threshold region separates a low--prevalence, low--diversity region of parameter space from a high--diversity, high--prevalence region. The location of the threshold region is determined by the reproduction number of the pathogen and the intensity of cross--immunity, with the sharpness of the transition being determined by the manner in which immunity accrues with repeated infections. Host population size and cross--immunity are found to be the most decisive factors in determining pathogen diversity. While the model framework developed is simplified, we show that it can capture essential aspects of the complex evolutionary dynamics of pathogens such as influenza.\%U http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/271/1556/2431.full.pdf},

	Abstract = {Strain structure is of fundamental importance in the underlying dynamics of a number of pathogens. However, previous models have been too complex to accommodate many strains. This paper offers a solution to this problem, in the form of a simple model that is capable of capturing the dynamics of a large number of antigenic types that interact via host cross-immunity. We derive the structure of the model, which can manage the complexity of many strains by using a status-based formulation, assuming polarized immunity and cross-immunity act to reduced transmission probability. We then apply the model to address basic questions in strain dynamics, focusing particularly on the interpandemic dynamics of influenza. This model shows that strains have a tendency to ``cluster.'' For a long infectious period, relative to host lifetime, clusters may coexist. By contrast, a short infectious period leads to a single dominant cluster at any given time. We show how the speed of cluster replacement depends on the specificity of cross-immunity and on the underlying pathogen mutation rate.},

	Abstract = {Cross-reactive antibodies produced by a mammalian host during infection by a particular microparasitic strain usually have the effect of reducing the probability of the host being infected by a different, but closely related, pathogen strain. Such cross-reactive immunological responses thereby induce between-strain competition within the pathogen population. However, in some cases such as dengue virus, evidence suggests that cross-reactive antibodies act to enhance rather than restrict the severity of a subsequent infection by another strain. This cooperative mechanism is thought to explain why pre-existing immunity to dengue virus is an important risk factor for the development of severe disease (i.e., dengue shock syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever). In this paper, we explore the effect of antibody-dependent enhancement on the transmission dynamics of multistrain pathogen populations. We show that enhancement frequently may generate complex and persistent cyclical or chaotic epidemic behavior. Furthermore, enhancement acts to permit the coexistence of all strains where in its absence only one or a subset would persist.},

	Abstract = {Ecological interference between unrelated diseases, caused by the temporary or permanent removal of individuals susceptible to one disease following infection with another, might be an important mechanism underlying epidemics. In this paper, we explore the potential dynamic consequences of interference by analyzing a two-disease model. By studying the stability domain of the model's equilibria, we find that the stable region of the two-disease endemic state becomes increasingly smaller as the strength of interference (largely determined by the disease-induced mortality) increases. When seasonal changes are included in the transmission rates, the bifurcation structure of the model's periodic cycles reveals that when the two diseases have similar mean transmission rates, multiple attractors in which the two diseases are strongly correlated can coexist, and that when the two diseases have very different mean transmission rates, the one with higher mean transmission rate may determine the dynamics of the system, with the other infection mimicking the behavior. We conclude that ecological interference can have important effects on the dynamical pattern of interacting diseases, the extent of which is determined by the epidemiological features of the diseases, their mean transmission rates in particular},

	Abstract = {An important issue in population biology is the dynamic interaction between pathogens. Interest has focused mainly on the indirect interaction of pathogen strains, mediated by cross immunity. However, a mechanism has recently been proposed for 'ecological interference' between pathogens through the removal of individuals from the susceptible pool after an acute infection. To explore this possibility, we have analysed and modelled historical measles and whooping cough records. Here we show that ecological interference is particularly strong when fatal infections permanently remove susceptibles. Disease interference has substantial dynamical consequences, making multi-annual outbreaks of different infections characteristically out of phase. So, when disease prevalence is high and is associated with significant mortality, it might be impossible to understand epidemic patterns by studying pathogens in isolation. This new ecological null model has important consequences for understanding the multi-strain dynamics of pathogens such as dengue and echoviruses},

@article{vasco_tracking_2007,
	Abstract = {Traditionally, epidemiological studies have focused on understanding the dynamics of a single pathogen, assuming no interactions with other pathogens. Recently, a large body of work has begun to explore the effects of immune-mediated interactions, arising from cross-immunity and antibody-dependent enhancement, between related pathogen strains. In addition, ecological processes such as a temporary period of convalescence and pathogen-induced mortality have led to the concept of ecological interference between unrelated diseases. There remains, however, the need for a systematic study of both immunological and ecological processes within a single framework. In this paper, we develop a general two-pathogen single-host model of pathogen interactions that simultaneously incorporates these mechanisms. We are then able to mechanistically explore how immunoecological processes mediate interactions between diseases for a pool of susceptible individuals. We show that the precise nature of the interaction can induce either competitive or cooperative associations between pathogens. Understanding the dynamic implications of multi-pathogen associations has potentially important public health consequences. Such a framework may be especially helpful in disentangling the effects of partially cross-immunizing infections that affect populations with a pre-disposition towards immunosuppression such as children and the elderly},

There are indications that HIV-1 interacts significantly with many  other parasitic infections within individual hosts, but the population-level impacts of co-infection are not well-characterized. Here we consider how alteration of host immune status due to HIV-1 infection may influence the emergence of novel parasite strains. We review clinical and epidemiological evidence from five parasitic diseases (malaria, leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis, trypanosomiasis and strongyloidiasis) with emphasis on how HIV-1 co-infection alters individual susceptibility and infectiousness for the parasites. We then introduce a simple modelling framework that allows us to project how these individual-level properties might influence population-level dynamics. We find that HIV-1 can facilitate invasion by parasite strains in many circumstances and  we identify threshold values of HIV-1 prevalence that allow otherwise unsustainable parasite strains to invade successfully. Definitive evidence to test these predicted effects is largely lacking, and we conclude by discussing challenges in interpreting available data and priorities for future studies.},

	Abstract = {Concurrent infections with multiple parasites are ubiquitous in nature. Coinfecting parasites can interact with one another in a variety of ways, including through the host's immune system via mechanisms such as immune trade-offs and immunosuppression. These within-host immune processes mediating interactions among parasites have been described in detail, but how they scale up to determine disease dynamic patterns at the population level is only beginning to be explored. In this review, we use helminth--microparasite coinfection as a model for examining how within-host immunological effects may influence the ecological outcome of microparasitic diseases, with a specific focus on disease invasion. The current literature on coinfection between helminths and major microparasitic diseases includes many studies documenting the effects of helminths on individual host responses to microparasites. In many cases, the observed host responses map directly onto parameters relevant for quantifying disease dynamics; however, there have been few attempts at integrating data on individual-level effects into theoretical models to extrapolate from the individual to the population level. Moreover, there is considerable variability in the particular combination of disease parameters affected by helminths across different microparasite systems. We develop a conceptual framework identifying some potential sources of such variability: Pathogen persistence and severity, and resource availability to hosts. We also generate testable hypotheses regarding diseases and the environmental contexts when the effects of helminths on microparasite dynamics should be most pronounced. Finally, we use a case study of helminth and mycobacterial coinfection in the African buffalo to illustrate both progress and challenges in understanding the population-level consequences of within-host immunological interactions, and conclude with suggestions for future research that will help improve our understanding of the effects of coinfection on dynamics of infectious diseases.},

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the 18S rRNA gene was used in feces from 51 calves (3-12 months of age), 71 buffalo, 71 impala and 72 elephant, and sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene was done on PCR-RFLP-positive wildlife samples. Cryptosporidium spp. were detected in 8\% (4/51) of the calves and identified as C. andersoni (2/4) and C. bovis (2/4). Four of the 214 wildlife samples were positive for Cryptosporidium with a prevalence of 2.8\% each in impala and buffalo. Cryptosporidium ubiquitum was detected in two impala and one buffalo, and C. bovis in one buffalo. A concurrent questionnaire conducted among 120 farmers in the study area investigated contacts between wildlife species and livestock. Buffalo and impala had the highest probability of contact with cattle outside the KNP. Despite the fairly low prevalence found in wildlife and cattle, the circulation of zoonotic Cryptosporidium spp., such as C. ubiquitum, should be investigated further, particularly in areas of high HIV infection prevalence. Further studies should target younger animals in which the prevalence is likely to be higher. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Two antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, Ceditest (R) FMDV-NS for the detection of antibodies against the nonstructural proteins of all FMDV serotypes and Ceditest (R) FMDV type O for the detection of antibodies against serotype O, were evaluated under African endemic conditions where the presence of multiple serotypes and the use of nonpurified vaccines complicate serological diagnosis. Serum samples from 218 African buffalo, 758 cattle, 304 goats, and 88 sheep were tested using both kits, and selected samples were tested not only in serotype-specific ELISAs for antibodies against primarily FMDV serotype O, but also against other serotypes. The FMDV-NS assay detected far more positive samples (93\%) than the FMDV type O assay (30\%) in buffalo (P {\textless} 0.05), with predominant antibodies against the South African Territories (SAT) serotypes, while the seroprevalence was generally comparable in cattle with antibodies against serotype O elicited by infection and/or vaccination. However, some districts had higher seroprevalence using the FMDV type O assay indicating vaccination without infection, while 1 cattle herd with antibodies against the SAT serotypes had far more positive samples (85\%) using the FMDV-NS versus the FMDV type O (10\%), consistent with the latter test's lower sensitivity for antibodies against SAT serotypes. Based on the current investigation, the FMDV type O ELISA may be limited by the presence of SAT serotypes. The FMD NS assay worked well as a screening test for antibodies against all FMDV serotypes present in Uganda; however, as long as nonpurified vaccines are applied in the region, this test cannot be used to differentiate between vaccinated and infected animals.},

	Abstract = {Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic mosquito-borne virus disease of livestock and wild ruminants that has been identified as a risk for international spread. Typically, the disease occurs in geographically limited outbreaks associated with high rainfall events and can cause massive losses of livestock. It is unclear how RVF virus persists during inter-epidemic periods but cryptic cycling of the virus in wildlife populations may play a role. We investigated the role that free-living African buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) might play in inter-epidemic circulation of the virus and looked for geographic, age and sex patterns of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection in African buffalo. Buffalo serum samples were collected (n = 1615) in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, during a period of 1996-2007 and tested for antibodies to RVF. We found that older animals were more likely to be seropositive for anti-RVFV antibody than younger animals, but sex was not correlated with the likelihood of being anti-RVFV antibody positive. We also found geographic variation within KNP; herds in the south were more likely to have acquired anti-RVFV antibody than herds farther north - which could be driven by host or vector ecology. In all years of the study between 1996 and 2007, we found young buffalo (under 2 years of age) that were seropositive for anti-RVFV antibody, with prevalence ranging between 0 and 27\% each year, indicating probable circulation. In addition, we also conducted a 4-year longitudinal study on 227 initially RVFV seronegative buffalo to look for evidence of seroconversion outside known RVF outbreaks within our study period (2008-2012). In the longitudinal study, we found five individuals that seroconverted from anti-RVFV antibody negative to anti-RVFV antibody positive, outside of any detected outbreak. Overall, our results provide evidence of long-term undetected circulation of RVFV in the buffalo population.},

	Abstract = {Most hosts are concurrently or sequentially infected with multiple parasites; thus, fully understanding interactions between individual parasite species and their hosts depends on accurate characterization of the parasite community. For parasitic nematodes, noninvasive methods for obtaining quantitative, species-specific infection data in wildlife are often unreliable. Consequently, characterization of gastrointestinal nematode communities of wild hosts has largely relied on lethal sampling to isolate and enumerate adult worms directly from the tissues of dead hosts. The necessity of lethal sampling severely restricts the host species that can be studied, the adequacy of sample sizes to assess diversity, the geographic scope of collections and the research questions that can be addressed. Focusing on gastrointestinal nematodes of wild African buffalo, we evaluated whether accurate characterization of nematode communities could be made using a noninvasive technique that combined conventional parasitological approaches with molecular barcoding. To establish the reliability of this new method, we compared estimates of gastrointestinal nematode abundance, prevalence, richness and community composition derived from lethal sampling with estimates derived from our noninvasive approach. Our noninvasive technique accurately estimated total and species-specific worm abundances, as well as worm prevalence and community composition when compared to the lethal sampling method. Importantly, the rate of parasite species discovery was similar for both methods, and only a modest number of barcoded larvae (n=10) were needed to capture key aspects of parasite community composition. Overall, this new noninvasive strategy offers numerous advantages over lethal sampling methods for studying nematode-host interactions in wildlife and can readily be applied to a range of study systems.},

	Abstract = {Theileria parva is the causative agent of Corridor disease in cattle in South Africa. The African buffalo (Syncerus coffer) is the reservoir host, and, as these animals are important for eco-tourism in South Africa, it is compulsory to test and certify them disease free prior to translocation. A T. parva-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test based on the small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) gene is one of the tests used for the diagnosis of the parasite in buffalo and cattle in South Africa. However, because of the high similarity between the 18S rRNA gene sequences of T. parva and Theileria sp. (buffalo), the latter is also amplified by the real-time PCR primers, although it is not detected by the T. parva-specific hybridization probes. Preliminary sequencing studies have revealed a small number of sequence differences within the 185 rRNA gene in both species but the extent of this sequence variation is unknown. The aim of the current study was to sequence the 18S rRNA genes of T. parva and Theileria sp. (buffalo), and to determine whether all identified genotypes can be correctly detected by the real-time PCR assay. The reverse line blot (RLB) hybridization assay was used to identify T. parva and Theileria sp. (buffalo) positive samples from buffalo blood samples originating from the Kruger National Park, Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, the Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Park, and a private game ranch in the Hoedspruit area. T. parva and Theileria sp. (buffalo) were identified in 42\% and 28\%, respectively, of 252 samples, mainly as mixed infections. The full-length 18S rRNA gene of selected samples was amplified, cloned and sequenced. From a total of 20 sequences obtained, 10 grouped with previously published T. parva sequences from GenBank while 10 sequences grouped with a previously published Theileria sp. (buffalo) sequence. All these formed a monophyletic group with known pathogenic Theileria species. Our phylogenetic analyses confirm the distinction between Theileria sp. (buffalo) and T. parva and indicate the existence of a single group of T. parva and two Theileria sp. (buffalo) 18S rRNA gene variants in the African buffalo. Despite the observed variation in the full-length parasite 18S rRNA gene sequences, the area in the V4 hypervariable region where the RLB and real-time PCR hybridization probes were developed was relatively conserved. The T. parva specific real-time PCR assay was able to successfully detect all T. parva variants and, although amplicons were obtained from Theileria sp. (buffalo) DNA, none of the Theileria sp. (buffalo) 18S rRNA sequence variants were detected by the T. parva-specific hybridization probes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is a natural reservoir host for both pathogenic and nonpathogenic Theileria species. These often occur naturally as mixed infections in buffalo. Although the benign and mildly pathogenic forms do not have any significant economic importance, their presence could complicate the interpretation of diagnostic test results aimed at the specific diagnosis of the pathogenic Theileria parva in cattle and buffalo in South Africa. The 18S rRNA gene has been used as the target in a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay for the detection of T. parva infections. However, the extent of sequence variation within this gene in the non-pathogenic Theileria spp. of the Africa buffalo is not well known. The aim of this study was, therefore, to characterise the full-length 185 rRNA genes of Theileria mutans, Theileria sp. (strain MSD) and T. velifera and to determine the possible influence of any sequence variation on the specific detection of T. parva using the 18S rRNA qPCR. The reverse line blot (RLB) hybridization assay was used to select samples which either tested positive for several different Theileria spp., or which hybridised only with the Babesia/Theileria genus-specific probe and not with any of the Babesia or Theileria species-specific probes. The full-length 18S rRNA genes from 14 samples, originating from 13 buffalo and one bovine from different localities in South Africa, were amplified, cloned and the resulting recombinants sequenced. Variations in the 18S rRNA gene sequences were identified in T. mutans, Theileria sp. (strain MSD) and T. velifera, with the greatest diversity observed amongst the T. mu tans variants. This variation possibly explained why the RLB hybridization assay failed to detect T. mutans and T. velifera in some of the analysed samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Background: The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is a host for many pathogens known to cause economically important diseases and is often considered an important reservoir for livestock diseases. Theileriosis, heartwater, babesiosis and anaplasmosis are considered the most important tick-borne diseases of livestock in sub-Saharan Africa, resulting in extensive economic losses to livestock farmers in endemic areas. Information on the distribution of tick-borne diseases and ticks is scarce in Northern Botswana. Nevertheless, this data is necessary for targeting surveillance and control measures in livestock production at national level. Methods: In order to address this gap, we analyzed 120 blood samples from buffalo herds for the presence of common tick-borne haemoparasites causing disease in livestock, collected in two of the main wildlife areas of Northern Botswana: the Chobe National Park (CNP, n = 64) and the Okavango Delta (OD, n = 56). Results: Analysis of the reverse line blot (RLB) hybridization assay results revealed the presence of Theileria, Babesia, Anaplasma and Ehrlichia species, either as single or mixed infections. Among the Theileria spp. present, T. parva (60\%) and T. mutans (37\%) were the most prevalent. Other species of interest were Anaplasma marginale subsp. centrale (30\%), A. marginale (20\%), Babesia occultans (23\%) and Ehrlichia ruminantium (6\%). The indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) indicated 74\% of samples to be positive for the presence of T. parva antibodies. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) detected the highest level of animals infected with T. parva (81\% of the samples). The level of agreement between the tests for detection of T. parva positive animals was higher between qPCR and IFAT (kappa = 0.56), than between qPCR and RLB (kappa = 0.26) or the latter and IFAT (kappa = 0.15). Conclusions: This is the first report of tick-borne haemoparasites in African buffalo from northern Botswana, where animals from the CNP showed higher levels of infection than those from OD. Considering the absence of fences separating wildlife and livestock in the CNP and the higher levels of some parasite species in buffalo from that area, surveillance of tick-borne diseases in livestock at the interface in the CNP should be prioritized.},

	Abstract = {The evolution and maintenance of elaborate secondary sexual characters in males have been the subject of intense interest since Darwin's time. Parasite-mediated sexual selection (PMSS) suggests that elaborate ornaments serve as honest indicators of male health and parasite resistance. Studies testing this key prediction of PMSS have largely focused on ornaments, with the role parasites might play in the maintenance of elaborate weapons being relatively understudied. Here, we tested whether weapon (horn) size was an indicator of health status in male and female African buffalo, Syncerus caffer. We examined whether individuals with larger horns were less likely to be infected with parasites, and had lower parasite loads and stronger immune systems. In males, horn size was significantly negatively correlated with the number of different parasites infecting an individual (parasite richness), the likelihood of infection with strongyle nematodes and coccidia, and strongyle intensity. In females, horn size was significantly negatively correlated with parasite richness, occurrence of coccidia infection, coccidia intensity and white blood cell count. These findings were robust when the effects of body condition, age and season were controlled for, consistent with the idea that horns function as honest indicators of health in both sexes. Our study provides new insight into the evolution and maintenance of elaborate weapons in mammals, suggesting a role for PMSS in both males and females.

Wild ruminants, such as the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), are thought to play a role in the epidemiology of these diseases. This study sought to expand the understanding of the role of buffalo in the maintenance of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) by determining seroprevalence to these viruses during an inter-epidemic period. Buffaloes from the Kruger National Park (n = 138) and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (n = 110) in South Africa were sampled and tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralising antibodies against LSDV and RVFV using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (I-ELISA) and the serum neutralisation test (SNT). The I-ELISA for LSDV and RVFV detected IgG antibodies in 70 of 248 (28.2\%) and 15 of 248 (6.1\%) buffaloes, respectively. Using the SNT, LSDV and RVFV neutralising antibodies were found in 5 of 66 (7.6\%) and 12 of 57 (21.1\%), respectively, of samples tested. The RVFV I-ELISA and SNT results correlated well with previously reported results. Of the 12 SNT RVFV-positive sera, three (25.0\%) had very high SNT titres of 1:640. Neutralising antibody titres of more than 1:80 were found in 80.0\% of the positive sera tested. The LSDV SNT results did not correlate with results obtained by the I-ELISA and neutralising antibody titres detected were low, with the highest (1:20) recorded in only two buffaloes, whilst 11 buffaloes (4.4\%) had evidence of co-infection with both viruses. Results obtained in this study complement other reports suggesting a role for buffaloes in the epidemiology of these diseases during inter-epidemic periods.},

We report infection patterns and fitness correlates of bovine brucellosis in African buffalo based on (1) 7 years of cross-sectional disease surveys and (2) a 4-year longitudinal study in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. We then used a matrix population model to translate these observed patterns into predicted population-level effects. 3. Annual brucellosis seroprevalence ranged from 8.7\% (95\% CI = 1.8-15.6) to 47.6\% (95\% CI = 35.1-60.1) increased with age until adulthood ({\textgreater} 6) and varied by location within KNP. Animals were on average in worse condition after testing positive for brucellosis (F =-5.074, P {\textless} 0.0001), and infection was associated with a 2.0 (95\% CI = 1.1-3.7) fold increase in mortality (chi(2) = 2.039, P = 0.036). Buffalo in low body condition were associated with lower reproductive success (F = 2.683, P = 0.034), but there was no association between brucellosis and pregnancy or being observed with a calf. 4. For the range of body condition scores observed in the population, the model-predicted growth rate was lambda = 1.11 (95\% CI = 1.02-1.21) in herds without brucellosis and lambda = 1.00 (95\% CI = 0.85-1.16) when brucellosis seroprevalence was 30\%. 5. Our results suggest that brucellosis infection can potentially result in reduced population growth rates, but because these effects varied with demographic and environmental conditions, they may remain unseen without intensive, longitudinal monitoring.},

Africanastrongylus buceros gen. nov. et sp. nov. is characterized by a symmetrical tapering synlophe in the cervical region and a maximum of 60 ridges in males and females. Bursal structure is 2-2-1, with subequal Rays 4/5, massive Rays 8, and Rays 9/10, and a massive dorsal lobe that is reduced in length, laterally and dorsally inflated, and positioned ventral to externodorsal rays. Spicules are tripartite, and the gubernaculum is broadly alate in the anterior. A proconus is present. Among ostertagiines with a 2-2-1 bursa (Cervicaprastrongylus, Hyostrongylus, Mazamastrongylus, Sarwaria, Spiculopteragia, and Teladorsagia) specimens of Africanastrongylus are differentiated from respective genera based on the structure of the cervical synlophe, patterns of dorsal, externodorsal, lateral, and ventral rays, and configuration of the genital cone, gubernaculum, and spicules. Among 13 genera of the Ostertagiinae in the global fauna, 3 are entirely limited in distribution to Africa, including Africanastrongylus, Longistrongylus, and Pseudomarshallagia. Another 5 genera including Cervicaprastrongylus, Hyostrongylus, Marshallagia, Ostertagia, and Teladorsagia are represented as mosaics, with diversity centered in Eurasia or the Holarctic. Genera not represented in the African fauna include Camelostrongylus among Caprinae and some Antelopinae from Eurasia, Mazamastrongylus and Spiculopteragia in Cervidae from the Holarctic and Eurasia, respectively, Orloffia in Cervidae and Bovidae from the Holarctic, and Sarwaria among Tragulidae and Bovinae in southern Asia. The diverse nature of the ostertagiine fauna, with a disproportionate number of endemic genera relative to other regions of the northern hemisphere, may reflect the timing of episodic expansion events for artiodactyls into Africa from Eurasia during the Tertiary and Quaternary.},

In contrast, the lack of reports describing clinical MCF in the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) whether free ranging or captive has led to a perception that African buffaloes are resistant to MCF. During the last decade, several cases of MCF in African buffaloes were confirmed in South Africa and experience with seven of these cases is described in this report. Detection of viral nucleic acid in blood or tissues was successful in six African buffaloes that suffered from clinical signs compatible with MCF. Four were positive for infection with ovine herpesvirus type 2 (the causative virus of sheep-associated MCF), and two were positive for alcelaphine herpesvirus type 1 (causative virus of wildebeest-associated MCF). Histopathological examination of tissue samples from all the animals yielded typical lesions that were consistent with those described for MCF in domestic cattle. Developments in the management of African buffaloes translocated from their traditional habitats have likely contributed to the identification of another susceptible host in the subfamily Bovinae.},

In a retrospective analysis of organ material from an earlier study on wild mammals from the Seregenti National Park, 521 samples from 54 animals of 14 mammalian species were investigated. The presence of Chlamydiaceae was analyzed using molecular methods and immunohistochemistry. Chlamydial DNA was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues from large ruminants (African buffaloes, Syncerus coffer, n=4) and a large predator (spotted hyena, Crocuta crocuta, n=1). Microarray results revealed Chlamydia abortus in all cases, confirmed by sequencing of selected samples, and a mixed infection with Chlamydia abortus and Chlamydia pneumoniae in an African buffalo. This is the first report of Chlamydiaceae in African wildlife of the Serengeti area.},

	Abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) was first detected in Kruger National Park (KNP) in a single African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in 1990. In 1991/1992, 2,071 African buffalo were examined for BTB as part of a culling program that removed animals from all known herds in KNP. The prevalence of BTB in 1991/1992 was estimated to be 0\%, 4.4\% (+/-0.6\%), and 27.1\% (+/-1.4\%), in the north, central, and south zones of KNP, respectively. In 1998, a stratified, two-stage cluster sampling method was used to estimate that the prevalence of BTB was 1.5\% (+/-2.5\%), 16\% (+/-5.3\%), and 38.2\% (+/-6.3\%), in the north, central, and south zones, respectively. This represented a significant increase in prevalence (P less than or equal to 0.05) in the south and central zones, but not in the north zone. Continued monitoring of BTB in KNP is important for understanding disease transmission risks, potential population effects, and the efficacy of disease management strategies. The methodology and sample sizes used in 1998 are appropriate fur future BTB monitoring in KNP.},

	Abstract = {The number of African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer Sparrman, 1779) inhabiting Ruaha National Park, Tanzania, is thought to be declining, but little data exist to determine whether the population is actually in decline. As an initial phase of collecting population data, we conducted demographic surveys, faecal egg counts and gastrointestinal parasite identification in Ruaha's buffalo herds in September 2011 and 2013. Most herds encountered in the two surveys appeared to be in good health, but with fewer calves in 2013 compared with 2011. The herd-level body condition score was positively associated with the number of calves per 100 cows after adjusting for year, and the lower number of offspring in 2013 could possibly be associated with a below average rainfall in the 2012-2013 rainy season. Mean herd-level egg counts ranged from 83 to 140 and from 28 to 113 eggs per g faeces in 2011 and 2013, respectively. Haemonchus, Nematodirus, Cooperia and Oesophagostomum spp., as well as coccidian oocysts, were detected in the population. Monitoring herd demographics and baseline health parameters over time will provide insight into population performance, increase the understanding of population stressors and contribute to buffalo conservation within Ruaha National Park and other protected areas of Africa.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Outdoor malaria transmission is becoming an increasingly important problem in malaria control in Africa. Larval control is a promising intervention as it can target both indoor and outdoor biting mosquitoes. However, the currently available biolarvicide formulations have a short effective duration, and consequently larval control incurs a high operational expense due to the requirement for frequent re-treatment of larval habitats. Formulations of biolarvicides with long-lasting effects is highly desired. A recently developed FourStar{\textregistered} slow-release briquet formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis and Bacillus sphaericus was evaluated to test its efficacy on malaria vectors.METHODS: The study evaluated FourStar{\texttrademark} briquets 180-days formulation under semi-natural and natural conditions to test their efficacy in reducing the mosquito population in western Kenya. The semi-natural habitats used the formulation dissolved in rainwater with appropriate concentrations, and second-instar larvae of Anopheles gambiae were introduced and the number of surviving larvae and pupae produced was recorded daily as the outcome. The briquets formulation was then tested in natural habitats for efficacy on pupal productivity reduction in highland and lowland sites in western Kenya. The formulation was finally tested for efficacy in reducing adult mosquito populations in randomized clusters in western Kenya highland.RESULTS: In semi-natural conditions, the FourStar{\texttrademark} briquets 180-days formulation completely inhibited mosquito pupal production in the first 3 months, and then reduced pupal productivity by 87-98\% (P {\textless} 0.001) 4-6 months after application. In natural habitats, during the first 2 months no pupae were detected from any of the treated habitats in highland sites, and Anopheles spp. pupal density was reduced by 60-90\% in the next 3-5 months (P {\textless} 0.001). In the lowland site, pupal productivity reduction was 100\% in the first 3 months, and 75-90\% in the next 4-5 months (P {\textless} 0.001). The randomized cluster trial found that the application of the briquets formulation reduced mean densities of indoor-biting mosquitoes by 76-82\% (P {\textless} 0.001) and by 67-75\% (P {\textless} 0.001) for outdoor-biting mosquitoes.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that long-lasting biological larviciding was effective in reducing pupal productivity of larval habitats, and reducing indoor and outdoor resting mosquitoes. The study suggests that long-lasting microbial larviciding may be a promising complementary malaria vector control tool and warrants further large-scale evaluation},

Climate change has already increased the occurrence of diseases in some natural and agricultural systems, but in many cases, outcomes depend on the form of climate change and details of the host-pathogen system. In this review, we highlight research progress and gaps that have emerged during the past decade and develop a predictive framework that integrates knowledge from ecophysiology and community ecology with modeling approaches. Future work must continue to anticipate and monitor pathogen biodiversity and disease trends in natural ecosystems and identify opportunities to mitigate the impacts of climate-driven disease emergence},

All cages were equipped with plastic beakers that served as sites for oviposition and larval development. We measured the per capita daily mortality and emergence rates of the adults and size of adult females, and estimated the intrinsic rate of increase (r) and asymptotic density (K) for each adult population. populations at 26 degreesC had greater intrinsic rates of increase and lower asymptotic densities than populations at 22 and 24 degreesC. Populations at high temperatures initially had greater daily. per capita emergence rates, and steeper. declines in per capita emergence rate as density increased over tire course of the experiment, There was no temperature effect on the size of adult females nor on the per capita daily mortality rate of adults. Results indicated that populations of Ae. albopictus occurring in regions with relatively high summer temperatures are likely to have hiyh rates of population growth with populations of adults peaking early in the season. These populations mn)l attain relatively. low peak densities of adults. Populations occurring in regions with low summer temperatures are likely to experience slow, steady production of adults throughout the season with population size peaking later in the season, and may attain higher peal, densities of adults. Nigh temperature conditions, associated with climate change, may increase the rate of spread of Ae, albopictus by increasing rates of increase and by. enhancing colonization due to rapid population growth.},

	Abstract = {Mosquito larvae face numerous biotic and abiotic challenges that affect their development and survivorship, as well as adult fitness. We conducted two experiments under semi-natural conditions to evaluate the effects of intraspecific competition, nutrient limitation and sub-lethal doses of malathion on individual life history traits in adult Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae). In the first experiment, larvae of Cx. pipiens were reared at different intraspecific densities and exposed to sub-lethal doses of malathion. In the second experiment, different intraspecific densities of Cx. pipiens larvae were reared under conditions of low or high larval nutrients, and subsequent adults were fed on either water or 10\% sucrose solution. Malathion treatment had relatively minor effects compared with density, which had significant negative effects on development rate, survivorship to adulthood, body size (wing length) and longevity. As larval density increased, a sex ratio distortion in survivorship to adulthood emerged, in which a bias towards males was apparent. Nutrient-rich larval environments alleviated, in part, the effects of increasing density and extended the lifespan of mosquitoes fed on water and 10\% sucrose. Density-dependent alterations in adult longevity attributable to the larval environment are complex and show contrasting results depending on interactions with other environmental factors. This study suggests that larval resource availability and competition influence Cx. pipiens population growth correlates and have lasting effects on traits that relate to a mosquito's ability to vector pathogens},

In these studies, we show independent effects of rearing temperature on the immature aquatic stages and holding temperature on the adult terrestrial stage in terms of alterations in adult survival and progression of dengue-1 virus infection in the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus. Our studies show that adult survival was determined by adult-holding temperature, regardless of rearing conditions of the immature stages. In contrast, spread of virus throughout the body of the mosquito, a pre-requisite for transmission, was reduced when the immature stages were reared in cool conditions. These results show that immature-rearing temperature selectively modified mosquito traits that influence competency for viruses, and they further our understanding of the nature of temperature effects on interactions between mosquitoes and virus pathogens and risk of disease transmission.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Between 1995 and 2000, KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, experienced a marked increase in Plasmodium falciparum malaria, fuelled by pyrethroid and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. In response, vector control was strengthened and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) was deployed in the first Ministry of Health artemisinin-based combination treatment policy in Africa. In South Africa, effective vector and parasite control had historically ensured low-intensity malaria transmission. Malaria is diagnosed definitively and treatment is provided free of charge in reasonably accessible public-sector health-care facilities.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We reviewed four years of malaria morbidity and mortality data at four sentinel health-care facilities within KwaZulu-Natal's malaria-endemic area. In the year following improved vector control and implementation of AL treatment, malaria-related admissions and deaths both declined by 89\%, and outpatient visits decreased by 85\% at the sentinel facilities. By 2003, malaria-related outpatient cases and admissions had fallen by 99\%, and malaria-related deaths had decreased by 97\%. There was a concomitant marked and sustained decline in notified malaria throughout the province. No serious adverse events were associated causally with AL treatment in an active sentinel pharmacovigilance survey. In a prospective study with 42 d follow up, AL cured 97/98 (99\%) and prevented gametocyte developing in all patients. Consistent with the findings of focus group discussions, a household survey found self-reported adherence to the six-dose AL regimen was 96\%.CONCLUSION: Together with concurrent strengthening of vector control measures, the antimalarial treatment policy change to AL in KwaZulu-Natal contributed to a marked and sustained decrease in malaria cases, admissions, and deaths, by greatly improving clinical and parasitological cure rates and reducing gametocyte carriage},

	Abstract = {Vector abundance is an important factor governing disease risk and is often employed when modelling disease transmission. The longevity of the aquatic stages of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) dictates the rate of production of adults and hence the intensity of disease transmission. We examined how temperature influences the survival of larval stages (larvae and pupae) of Anopheles gambiae Giles sensu stricto and subsequent adult production of this most efficient malaria vector. Groups of 30 mosquitoes were reared at constant temperatures (from 10 to 40 degrees C) from the first instar and observed until death or metamorphosis of the last individual. Larvae developed into adults at temperatures ranging from 16 to 34 degrees C. Larval survival was shortest ({\textless} 7 days) at 10-12 degrees C and 38-40 degrees C, and longest ({\textgreater} 30 days) at 14-20 degrees C. Within the temperature range at which adults were produced, larval mortality was highest at the upper range 30-32 degrees C, with death (rather than adult emergence) representing over 70\% of the terminal events. The optimal survival temperatures were lower than the temperatures at which development was quickest, suggesting a critical relationship between temperature and the life cycle of the insect. These data provide fundamental information about An. gambiae s.s. adult productivity at different temperatures, which may facilitate the construction of process-based models of malaria risk in Africa and the development of early warning systems for epidemics},

	Abstract = {The parasites that cause malaria depend on Anopheles mosquitoes for transmission; because of this, mosquito population dynamics are a key determinant of malaria risk. Development and survival rates of both the Anopheles mosquitoes and the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria depend on temperature, making this a potential driver of mosquito population dynamics and malaria transmission. We developed a temperature-dependent, stage-structured delayed differential equation model to better understand how climate determines risk. Including the full mosquito life cycle in the model reveals that the mosquito population abundance is more sensitive to temperature than previously thought because it is strongly influenced by the dynamics of the juvenile mosquito stages whose vital rates are also temperature-dependent. Additionally, the model predicts a peak in abundance of mosquitoes old enough to vector malaria at more accurate temperatures than previous models. Our results point to the importance of incorporating detailed vector biology into models for predicting the risk for vector borne diseases},

	Abstract = {The ubiquity and importance of parasite co-infections in populations of free-living animals is beginning to be recognized, but few studies have demonstrated differential fitness effects of single infection versus co-infection in free-living populations. We investigated interactions between the emerging bacterial disease bovine tuberculosis (BTB) and the previously existing viral disease Rift Valley fever (RVF) in a competent reservoir host, African buffalo, combining data from a natural outbreak of RVF in captive buffalo at a buffalo breeding facility in 2008 with data collected from a neighbouring free-living herd of African buffalo in Kruger National Park. RVF infection was twice as likely in individual BTB+ buffalo as in BTB- buffalo, which, according to a mathematical model, may increase RVF outbreak size at the population level. In addition, co-infection was associated with a far higher rate of fetal abortion than other infection states. Immune interactions between BTB and RVF may underlie both of these interactions, since animals with BTB had decreased innate immunity and increased pro-inflammatory immune responses. This study is one of the first to demonstrate how the consequences of emerging infections extend beyond direct effects on host health, potentially altering the dynamics and fitness effects of infectious diseases that had previously existed in the ecosystem on free-ranging wildlife populations.},

	Abstract = {Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic mosquito-borne virus disease of livestock and wild ruminants that has been identified as a risk for international spread. Typically, the disease occurs in geographically limited outbreaks associated with high rainfall events and can cause massive losses of livestock. It is unclear how RVF virus persists during inter-epidemic periods but cryptic cycling of the virus in wildlife populations may play a role. We investigated the role that free-living African buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) might play in inter-epidemic circulation of the virus and looked for geographic, age and sex patterns of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection in African buffalo. Buffalo serum samples were collected (n = 1615) in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, during a period of 1996-2007 and tested for antibodies to RVF. We found that older animals were more likely to be seropositive for anti-RVFV antibody than younger animals, but sex was not correlated with the likelihood of being anti-RVFV antibody positive. We also found geographic variation within KNP; herds in the south were more likely to have acquired anti-RVFV antibody than herds farther north - which could be driven by host or vector ecology. In all years of the study between 1996 and 2007, we found young buffalo (under 2 years of age) that were seropositive for anti-RVFV antibody, with prevalence ranging between 0 and 27\% each year, indicating probable circulation. In addition, we also conducted a 4-year longitudinal study on 227 initially RVFV seronegative buffalo to look for evidence of seroconversion outside known RVF outbreaks within our study period (2008-2012). In the longitudinal study, we found five individuals that seroconverted from anti-RVFV antibody negative to anti-RVFV antibody positive, outside of any detected outbreak. Overall, our results provide evidence of long-term undetected circulation of RVFV in the buffalo population.},

	Abstract = {Solar radiation, which influences temperature and hydroperiod, should strongly influence colonization, development rate, development strategies and survival in temporary pools. We assessed these hypotheses at two spatial microscales with varying microclimate. One scale, ca. 200 m, was opposing slopes of a canyon on MT Carmel, Israel, referred to as 'Evolution Canyon' (Nevo, 1995). Due primarily to differential solar radiation, the warmer and drier South-facing slope (SFS) supports a savanna-like open park forest while the cooler, moister North-facing slope (NFS) is heavily forested, primarily with live oak. Using artificial pools, we assessed how these close but contrasting environments may influence developmental plasticity in the frog, Hyla savignyi, and colonization of insects. As expected, hydroperiod was considerably longer on the NFS. Hyla tadpole development was significantly faster on the SFS, while size at metamorphosis was greater on the NFS. Insect species richness was higher in NFS pools. The most common species, Culex pipiens, oviposited significantly more in NFS pools than in SFS pools. In the second scale, we placed pools only meters apart, but varying in shade and thus maximum temperature at Haifa University Campus, MT Carmel. Species richness and maximum temperature among pools were not correlated during winter and early spring (cool to mild temperatures), but were strongly and negatively correlated during early summer (hot temperatures). Thermal tolerance in the laboratory of selected species matched their thermal spatial distribution in the field. These results indicate that temperature can play a strong role in affecting developmental strategies, species' distributions and community structure in temporary pools over a very small spatial scale.},

	Abstract = {Ecological theory predicts, and empirical research shows, that species sharing the same trophic level as a target species (hereafter controphic species) can have large direct and indirect effects on the target species by sharing resources and/or by serving as alternative prey to predators. Yet, the roles of controphic species of mosquito larvae in affecting mosquito populations have received little attention. Published empirical evidence, although scarce, suggests that controphic species such as zooplankton and anuran larvae compete with mosquito larvae, can positively affect mosquito larvae by consuming bacteria that are pathogenic to mosquito larvae, reduce predation on mosquito larvae by serving as alternative prey, and ultimately cause increased predation on mosquito larvae by causing a numerical response in the predator. We conclude that more extensive theoretical and empirical studies in elucidating the roles of controphic species will better allow us to predict mosquito population dynamics and allow for better management of mosquitoes},

@misc{braack_malar_2016,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite high levels of naturally-acquired immunity (NAI) within local communities in malaria high transmission settings in Africa, such people often experience clinical disease during peak transmission months due to high parasite challenge. Major recruiters of unskilled labour in high-transmission malaria settings in Africa generally withhold chemoprophylactic medication from this large component of their labour force, which if administered during peak "malaria season" could reduce incidence of clinical malaria without unduly affecting NAI.COMMENTARY: Naturally acquired immunity confers protection against severe clinical disease and death, but does not prevent mild clinical disease and, therefore, still results in worker absence and worker debilitation. Evidence exists that NAI persists despite periodic parasite clearance and therefore provides opportunity for drug prophylaxis during peak transmission months, which contributes to broader malaria elimination objectives, community well-being, and reduced absence from work. Such chemoprophylaxis could be by way of standard daily or weekly supervised administration of prophylactics during peak transmission months, or occasional intermittent preventive treatment (IPT), all aimed at reducing parasite burden and clinical disease. However, challenges exist regarding compliance with drug regimens over extended periods and high parasite resistance to recommended IPT drugs over much of Africa. Despite withholding chemoprophylactics, most large companies nevertheless pursue social responsibility programmes for malaria reduction by way of vigorous indoor residual spraying and bed net provision.CONCLUSIONS: The lack of clear understanding regarding functioning of NAI and its role in malaria elimination campaigns, concerns about drug resistance and appropriate drug choice, lack of studies in the use of IPT in people other than pregnant women and small children, plus lack of guidance regarding drug options for IPT in the face of widespread resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, means that large contractors in malaria endemic settings will likely continue to withhold malaria prophylactic drugs from locally-recruited workers, with adverse consequences on workforce well-being. Nevertheless, if the point of chemoprophylaxis is to reduce clinical malaria by way of reducing parasite challenge without significantly impacting NAI, then a comparable result can be achieved by implementation of effective vector reduction programmes which minimize parasite transmission but maintain NAI},

@article{brady_vectorial_2016,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major gains have been made in reducing malaria transmission in many parts of the world, principally by scaling-up coverage with long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying. Historically, choice of vector control intervention has been largely guided by a parameter sensitivity analysis of George Macdonald's theory of vectorial capacity that suggested prioritizing methods that kill adult mosquitoes. While this advice has been highly successful for transmission suppression, there is a need to revisit these arguments as policymakers in certain areas consider which combinations of interventions are required to eliminate malaria.METHODS AND RESULTS: Using analytical solutions to updated equations for vectorial capacity we build on previous work to show that, while adult killing methods can be highly effective under many circumstances, other vector control methods are frequently required to fill effective coverage gaps. These can arise due to pre-existing or developing mosquito physiological and behavioral refractoriness but also due to additive changes in the relative importance of different vector species for transmission. Furthermore, the optimal combination of interventions will depend on the operational constraints and costs associated with reaching high coverage levels with each intervention.CONCLUSIONS: Reaching specific policy goals, such as elimination, in defined contexts requires increasingly non-generic advice from modelling. Our results emphasize the importance of measuring baseline epidemiology, intervention coverage, vector ecology and program operational constraints in predicting expected outcomes with different combinations of interventions},

	Abstract = {Vector-borne diseases continue to contribute significantly to the global burden of disease, and cause epidemics that disrupt health security and cause wider socioeconomic impacts around the world. All are sensitive in different ways to weather and climate conditions, so that the ongoing trends of increasing temperature and more variable weather threaten to undermine recent global progress against these diseases. Here, we review the current state of the global public health effort to address this challenge, and outline related initiatives by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners. Much of the debate to date has centred on attribution of past changes in disease rates to climate change, and the use of scenario-based models to project future changes in risk for specific diseases. While these can give useful indications, the unavoidable uncertainty in such analyses, and contingency on other socioeconomic and public health determinants in the past or future, limit their utility as decision-support tools. For operational health agencies, the most pressing need is the strengthening of current disease control efforts to bring down current disease rates and manage short-term climate risks, which will, in turn, increase resilience to long-term climate change. The WHO and partner agencies are working through a range of programmes to (i) ensure political support and financial investment in preventive and curative interventions to bring down current disease burdens; (ii) promote a comprehensive approach to climate risk management; (iii) support applied research, through definition of global and regional research agendas, and targeted research initiatives on priority diseases and population groups},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous malaria epidemics have occurred in western Kenya, with increasing frequency over the past 20 years. A variety of hypotheses on the etiology of these epidemics have been put forth, with different implications for surveillance and control. We investigated the ecological and socioeconomic factors promoting highland malaria vectors in the dry season after the 2002 epidemic.METHODS: Investigations were conducted in Kisii District during the dry season. Aquatic habitats in were surveyed for presence of malaria vectors. Brick-making pits were further investigated for co-associations of larval densities with emergent vegetation, habitat age, and predator diversity. Indoor spray catches were completed in houses near aquatic habitats. Participatory rural appraisals (PRAs) were conducted with 147 community members.RESULTS: The most abundant habitat type containing Anopheles larvae was brick-making pits. Vegetation and habitat age were positively associated with predator diversity, and negatively associated with mosquito density. Indoor spray catches found that houses close to brick-making sites had malaria vectors, whereas those next to swamps did not. PRAs revealed that brick-making has grown rapidly in highland swamps due to a variety of socioeconomic pressures in the region.CONCLUSION: Brick-making, an important economic activity, also generates dry season habitats for malaria vectors in western Kenya. Specifically, functional brick making pits contain less that 50\% as many predator taxa and greater than 50\% more mosquito larvae when compared with nearby abandoned brick making pits. Further evaluations of these disturbed, man-made habitats in the wet season may provide information important for malaria surveillance and control},

	Abstract = {Studies that consider both biotic and abiotic determinants of organisms are rare, but critical to delineate underlying determinants of community richness (number of taxa) and abundance (number of larvae per water body). In this study, we consider the importance of disturbance (salinity) and predator and competitor variables on mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in small ephemeral water bodies across the Wheatbelt of Western Australia. Similar to mosquitoes, and contrary to general perceptions, nonculicid aquatic fauna (aquatic fauna) had a common occurrence (number or percentage of water bodies occupied) and were abundant (average density) in ephemeral water bodies, albeit with a simplified trophic structure. The occurrence and density (number per unit area) of aquatic fauna between water bodies were highly variable, but general relationships of aquatic fauna with rainfall, water body surface area, salinity, and mosquitoes were apparent. In contrast to mosquitoes, the density of aquatic fauna declined with recent rainfall, implying mosquitoes may colonize newly created water bodies more quickly than aquatic fauna. Assemblages (richness and density of taxa) of aquatic fauna changed along a salinity gradient, as did mosquitoes, and this was pronounced for predator groups. Densities of mosquitoes were not limited by any single taxonomic group, by a negative relationship. However, the density and richness of mosquitoes generally declined in association with increased richness of predators and density of all other taxa (taxa not specifically classified as predators or competitors of mosquitoes). These relationships may account for higher densities of mosquitoes in smaller water bodies, where richness of predators is reduced and the density of other taxa does not differ from larger water bodies. Our results also suggest salinity in the Western Australia Wheatbelt may facilitate greater abundance of halotolerant mosquitoes, Aedes alboannulatus Macquart and Aedes camptorhynchus Thomson (a vector of Ross River virus [Togoviridae: Alphavirus]), by releasing them from biotic regulation},

WNV, an enveloped virus of the genus Flavivirus, is naturally maintained in an enzootic cycle between birds and mosquitoes, with occasional epizootic spillover causing disease in humans and horses. The mosquito vectors for WNV are widely distributed worldwide, and the known geographic range of WNV transmission and disease has continued to increase over the past 77 years. While most human infections with WNV are asymptomatic, severe neurological disease may develop resulting in long-term sequelae or death. Surveillance and preventive measures are an ongoing need to reduce the public health impact of WNV in areas with the potential for transmission.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Zambian Malaria Control Programme with the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) partners have developed the current National Malaria Strategic Plan (NMSP 2006-2011) which focuses on prevention based on the Integrated Vector Management (IVM) strategy. The introduction and implementation of an IVM strategy was planned in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) steps towards IVM implementation namely Introduction Phase, Consolidation Phase and Expansion Phase.ACHIEVEMENTS: IVM has created commitment for Legal and Regulatory policy review, monitoring, Research and a strong stewardship by the chemical suppliers. It has also leveraged additional resources, improved inter-sectoral collaboration, capacity building and enhanced community participation which facilitated a steady scaling up in coverage and utilisation of key preventive interventions. Thus, markedly reducing malaria incidence and case fatalities in the country.CONCLUSION: Zambia has successfully introduced, consolidated and expanded IVM activities. Resulting in increased coverage and utilization of interventions and markedly reducing malaria-related morbidity and mortality while ensuring a better protection of the environment},

The influence of human-induced or ecological changes on the risk of disease outbreaks is undeniable. However, few hypotheses have been proposed which address the re-emergence of these diseases, the spread of these viruses to previously uninfected areas and their establishment therein. Host and vector movements play an important role in the dissemination of pathogens, and the ability of these diseases to colonise previously uninfected areas may be explained by the diversity of hosts and vectors, the presence of favourable ecological conditions, and the successful adaptations of vectors or pathogens to new ecosystems. The objective of this paper is to describe the epidemiological processes of the vector-borne diseases Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever, Japanese encephalitis and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.},

	Abstract = {We perform sensitivity analyses on a mathematical model of malaria transmission to determine the relative importance of model parameters to disease transmission and prevalence. We compile two sets of baseline parameter values: one for areas of high transmission and one for low transmission. We compute sensitivity indices of the reproductive number (which measures initial disease transmission) and the endemic equilibrium point (which measures disease prevalence) to the parameters at the baseline values. We find that in areas of low transmission, the reproductive number and the equilibrium proportion of infectious humans are most sensitive to the mosquito biting rate. In areas of high transmission, the reproductive number is again most sensitive to the mosquito biting rate, but the equilibrium proportion of infectious humans is most sensitive to the human recovery rate. This suggests strategies that target the mosquito biting rate (such as the use of insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying) and those that target the human recovery rate (such as the prompt diagnosis and treatment of infectious individuals) can be successful in controlling malaria},

	Abstract = {Climatic changes forecasted in the coming years are likely to result in substantial alterations to the distributions and populations of vectors of arthropod-borne pathogens. Characterization of the effect of temperature shifts on the life history traits of specific vectors is needed to more accurately define how such changes could impact the epidemiological patterns of vector-borne disease. Here, we determined the effect of temperatures including 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32 degrees C on development time, immature survival, adult survival, mosquito size, blood feeding, and fecundity of both field and colonized populations of the Culex mosquitoes Culex pipiens L., Culex quinquefasciatus Say, and Culex restuans Theobald. Our results demonstrate that temperature significantly affects all of these traits, yet also that the extent of this effect is at times incongruent among temperatures, as well as being population and species-specific. Comparisons of colonized mosquitoes with field populations generally demonstrate decreased adult and immature survival, increased blood feeding and egg production, and significant variation in the effects of temperature, indicating that such colonies are not fully representative of natural populations. Results with field populations in general indicate that increases in temperature are likely to accelerate mosquito development, and that this effect is greater at temperatures below 24 degrees C, but also that temperature significantly increases mortality. Among field populations, Cx. restuans were most affected by temperature increases, with decreased longevity relative to other species and significant increases in adult and immature mortality measured with each incremental temperature increase. Despite the unique climates characteristic of the geographic ranges of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. pipiens, evidenceof significant species-specific adaptation to temperature ranges was not seen. Taken together, these results indicate that geographic region, as well as species and population differences, must be considered when measuring the effect of temperature on vector populations.},

@article{coetzee_bluetongue:_2012,
	Abstract = {Bluetongue (BT) is a non-contagious, infectious, arthropod transmitted viral disease of domestic and wild ruminants that is caused by the bluetongue virus (BTV), the prototype member of the Orbivirus genus in the family Reoviridae. Bluetongue was first described in South Africa, where it has probably been endemic in wild ruminants since antiquity. Since its discovery BT has had a major impact on sheep breeders in the country and has therefore been a key focus of research at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Research Institute in Pretoria, South Africa. Several key discoveries were made at this Institute, including the demonstration that the aetiological agent of BT was a dsRNA virus that is transmitted by Culicoides midges and that multiple BTV serotypes circulate in nature. It is currently recognized that BT is endemic throughout most of South Africa and 22 of the 26 known serotypes have been detected in the region. Multiple serotypes circulate each vector season with the occurrence of different serotypes depending largely on herd-immunity. Indigenous sheep breeds, cattle and wild ruminants are frequently infected but rarely demonstrate clinical signs, whereas improved European sheep breeds are most susceptible. The immunization of susceptible sheep remains the most effective and practical control measure against BT. In order to protect sheep against multiple circulating serotypes, three pentavalent attenuated vaccines have been developed. Despite the proven efficacy of these vaccines in protecting sheep against the disease, several disadvantages are associated with their use in the field.},

@article{couret_meta-analysis_2013,
	Abstract = {Meta-analysis of 33 studies of developmental timing of Culex pipiens s.l. Linnaeus demonstrates that development rate, or the rate of progression through immature life stadia, is primarily driven by temperature, whereas immature survival is driven by temperature, density, and variability in the environmental conditions. As expected, the linear relationship of temperature and development rate is positive for the larval period as well as development to adult emergence. However, the strength of this association varies significantly. Variation in development rate can be explained using additional environmental factors of intraspecific rearing density, sex, and study methodology. Heterogeneity in development rates even once temperature has been considered emphasizes the need for further research of multiple environmental factors and in changing environments. Immature survival is also significantly impacted by variability in environmental conditions. Development rates vary between subspecies of Cx. pipiens, but these population differences are no longer significant once an environmental factor of temperature is considered. Thus, variability in development rate of these insects appears to be primarily driven by response to certain environmental conditions rather than differences between populations. Broad patterns of phenotypic variation across latitude and 96 yr of empirical estimates were not significant once environmental rearing conditions had been considered.},

	Abstract = {Background: Development rates of Aedes aegypti are known to vary with respect to many abiotic and biotic factors including temperature, resource availability, and intraspecific competition. The relative importance of these factors and their interactions are not well established across populations. We performed meta-analysis on a dataset of development rate estimates from 49 studies. Results: Meta-analytic results indicated that the environmental factor of temperature is sufficient to explain development rate variability in Ae. aegypti. While diet and density may greatly impact other developmental phenotypes, these results suggest that for development rate these factors should never be considered to the exclusion of temperature. The effect of temperature on development rate is not homogenous or constant. The sources of heterogeneity of the effect of temperature are difficult to analyze due to lack of consistent reporting of larval rearing methods. Conclusions: Temperature is the most important ecological determinant of development rate in Ae. aegypti, but its effect is heterogeneous. Ignoring this heterogeneity is problematic for models of vector population and vector-borne disease transmission.},

	Abstract = {Relationships between traits of organisms and the structure of their metacommunities have so far mainly been explored with meta-analyses. We compared metacommunities of a wide variety of aquatic organism groups (12 groups, ranging from bacteria to fish) in the same set of 99 ponds to minimise biases inherent to meta-analyses. In the category of passive dispersers, large-bodied groups showed stronger spatial patterning than small-bodied groups suggesting an increasing impact of dispersal limitation with increasing body size. Metacommunities of organisms with the ability to fly (i.e. insect groups) showed a weaker imprint of dispersal limitation than passive dispersers with similar body size. In contrast, dispersal movements of vertebrate groups (fish and amphibians) seemed to be mainly confined to local connectivity patterns. Our results reveal that body size and dispersal mode are important drivers of metacommunity structure and these traits should therefore be considered when developing a predictive framework for metacommunity dynamics},

@article{endo_environmental_2016,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria transmission is complex, involving a range of hydroclimatological, biological, and environmental processes. The high degree of non-linearity in these processes makes it difficult to predict and intervene against malaria. This study seeks both to define a minimal number of malaria transmission determinants, and to provide a theoretical basis for sustainable environmental manipulation to prevent malaria transmission.METHODS: Using a field-tested mechanistic malaria model, HYDREMATS, a theoretical study was conducted under hypothetical conditions. Simulations were conducted with a range of hydroclimatological and environmental conditions: temperature (t), length of wet season (Twet), storm inter-arrival time (Tint), persistence of vector breeding pools (Ton), and distribution of houses from breeding pools and from each other (Xdist and Ydist, respectively). Based on the theoretical study, a malaria time scale, To, and a predictive theory of malaria transmission were introduced. The performance of the predictive theory was compared against the observational malaria transmission data in West Africa. Population density was used to estimate the scale that describes the spatial distribution of houses.RESULTS: The predictive theory shows a universality in malaria endemic conditions when plotted using two newly-introduced dimension-less parameters. The projected malaria transmission potential compared well with the observation data, and the apparent differences were discussed. The results illustrate the importance of spatial aspects in malaria transmission.CONCLUSIONS: The predictive theory is useful in measuring malaria transmission potential, and it can also provide guidelines on how to plan the layout of human habitats in order to prevent endemic malaria. Malaria-resistant villages can be designed by locating houses further than critical distances away from breeding pools or by removing pools within a critical distance from houses; the critical distance is described in the context of local climatology and hydrology},

	Abstract = {Surveillance of animal diseases in developing countries faces many constraints. Innovative tools and methods to enhance surveillance in remote and neglected areas should be defined, assessed and applied in close connection with local farmers, national stakeholders and international agencies. The authors performed a narrative synthesis of their own publications about surveillance in Madagascar and Cambodia. They analysed the data in light of their fieldwork experiences in the two countries' very challenging environments. The burden of animal and zoonotic diseases (e.g. avian influenza, African swine fever, Newcastle disease, Rift Valley fever) is huge in both countries which are among the poorest in the world. Being poor countries implies a lack of human and financial means to ensure effective surveillance of emerging and endemic diseases. Several recent projects have shown that new approaches can be proposed and tested in the field. Several advanced participatory approaches are promising and could be part of an innovative method for improving the dialogue among different actors in a surveillance system. Thus, participatory modelling, developed for natural resources management involving local stakeholders, could be applied to health management, including surveillance. Data transmission could benefit from the large mobile-phone coverage in these countries. Ecological studies and advances in the field of livestock surveillance should guide methods for enhancing wildlife monitoring and surveillance. Under the umbrella of the One Health paradigm, and in the framework of a risk-based surveillance concept, a combination of participatory methods and modern technologies could help to overcome the constraints present in low-income countries. These unconventional approaches should be merged in order to optimise surveillance of emerging and endemic diseases in challenging environments},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the past decade malaria intervention coverage has been scaled up across Africa. However, it remains unclear what overall reduction in transmission is achievable using currently available tools.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed an individual-based simulation model for Plasmodium falciparum transmission in an African context incorporating the three major vector species (Anopheles gambiae s.s., An. arabiensis, and An. funestus) with parameters obtained by fitting to parasite prevalence data from 34 transmission settings across Africa. We incorporated the effect of the switch to artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT) and increasing coverage of long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) from the year 2000 onwards. We then explored the impact on transmission of continued roll-out of LLINs, additional rounds of indoor residual spraying (IRS), mass screening and treatment (MSAT), and a future RTS,S/AS01 vaccine in six representative settings with varying transmission intensity (as summarized by the annual entomological inoculation rate, EIR: 1 setting with low, 3 with moderate, and 2 with high EIRs), vector-species combinations, and patterns of seasonality. In all settings we considered a realistic target of 80\% coverage of interventions. In the low-transmission setting (EIR approximately 3 ibppy [infectious bites per person per year]), LLINs have the potential to reduce malaria transmission to low levels ({\textless}1\% parasite prevalence in all age-groups) provided usage levels are high and sustained. In two of the moderate-transmission settings (EIR approximately 43 and 81 ibppy), additional rounds of IRS with DDT coupled with MSAT could drive parasite prevalence below a 1\% threshold. However, in the third (EIR = 46) with An. arabiensis prevailing, these interventions are insufficient to reach this threshold. In both high-transmission settings (EIR approximately 586 and 675 ibppy), either unrealistically high coverage levels ({\textgreater}90\%) or novel tools and/or substantial social improvements will be required, although considerable reductions in prevalence can be achieved with existing tools and realistic coverage levels.CONCLUSIONS: Interventions using current tools can result in major reductions in P. falciparum malaria transmission and the associated disease burden in Africa. Reduction to the 1\% parasite prevalence threshold is possible in low- to moderate-transmission settings when vectors are primarily endophilic (indoor-resting), provided a comprehensive and sustained intervention program is achieved through roll-out of interventions. In high-transmission settings and those in which vectors are mainly exophilic (outdoor-resting), additional new tools that target exophagic (outdoor-biting), exophilic, and partly zoophagic mosquitoes will be required},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The widespread emergence of resistance to pyrethroids is a major threat to the gains made in malaria control. To monitor the presence and possible emergence of resistance against a variety of insecticides used for malaria control in Rwanda, nationwide insecticide resistance surveys were conducted in 2011 and 2013.METHODS: Larvae of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato mosquitoes were collected in 12 sentinel sites throughout Rwanda. These were reared to adults and analysed for knock-down and mortality using WHO insecticide test papers with standard diagnostic doses of the recommended insecticides. A sub-sample of tested specimens was analysed for the presence of knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations.RESULTS: A total of 14,311 mosquitoes were tested and from a sample of 1406 specimens, 1165 (82.9\%) were identified as Anopheles arabiensis and 241 (17.1\%) as Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto. Mortality results indicated a significant increase in resistance to lambda-cyhalothrin from 2011 to 2013 in 83\% of the sites, permethrin in 25\% of the sites, deltamethrin in 25\% of the sites and DDT in 50\% of the sites. Mosquitoes from 83\% of the sites showed full susceptibility to bendiocarb and 17\% of sites were suspected to harbour resistance that requires further confirmation. No resistance was observed to fenitrothion in all study sites during the entire survey. The kdr genotype results in An. gambiae s.s. showed that 67 (50\%) possessed susceptibility (SS) alleles, while 35 (26.1\%) and 32 (23.9\%) mosquitoes had heterozygous (RS) and homozygous (RR) alleles, respectively. Of the 591 An. arabiensis genotyped, 425 (71.9\%) possessed homozygous (SS) alleles while 158 (26.7\%) and 8 (1.4\%) had heterozygous (RS) and homozygous (RR) alleles, respectively. Metabolic resistance involving oxidase enzymes was also detected using the synergist PBO.CONCLUSION: This is the first nationwide study of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in Rwanda. It shows the gradual increase of insecticide resistance to pyrethroids (lambda-cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, permethrin) and organochlorines (DDT) and the large presence of target site insensitivity. The results demonstrate the need for Rwanda to expand monitoring for insecticide resistance including further metabolic resistance testing and implement an insecticide resistance management strategy to sustain the gains made in malaria control},

	Abstract = {Biotic interactions involving mosquito larvae are context dependent, with effects of interactions on populations altered by ecological conditions. Relative impacts of competition and predation change across a gradient of habitat size and permanence. Asymmetrical competition is common and ecological context changes competitive advantage, potentially facilitating landscape-level coexistence of competitors. Predator effects on mosquito populations sometimes depend on habitat structure and on emergent effects of multiple predators, particularly interference among predators. Nonlethal effects of predators on mosquito oviposition, foraging, and life history are common, and their consequences for populations and for mosquito-borne disease are poorly understood. Context-dependent beneficial effects of detritus shredders on mosquitoes occur in container habitats, but these interactions appear to involve more than simple resource modification by shredders. Investigations of context-dependent interactions among mosquito larvae will yield greater understanding of mosquito population dynamics and provide useful model systems for testing theories of context dependence in communities},

@article{kibret_malaria_2016,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has embarked on a new era of dam building to improve food security and promote economic development. Nonetheless, the future impacts of dams on malaria transmission are poorly understood and seldom investigated in the context of climate and demographic change.METHODS: The distribution of malaria in the vicinity of 1268 existing dams in SSA was mapped under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5. Population projections and malaria incidence estimates were used to compute population at risk of malaria in both RCPs. Assuming no change in socio-economic interventions that may mitigate impacts, the change in malaria stability and malaria burden in the vicinity of the dams was calculated for the two RCPs through to the 2080s. Results were compared against the 2010 baseline. The annual number of malaria cases associated with dams and climate change was determined for each of the RCPs.RESULTS: The number of dams located in malarious areas is projected to increase in both RCPs. Population growth will add to the risk of transmission. The population at risk of malaria around existing dams and associated reservoirs, is estimated to increase from 15 million in 2010 to 21-23 million in the 2020s, 25-26 million in the 2050s and 28-29 million in the 2080s, depending on RCP. The number of malaria cases associated with dams in malarious areas is expected to increase from 1.1 million in 2010 to 1.2-1.6 million in the 2020s, 2.1-3.0 million in the 2050s and 2.4-3.0 million in the 2080s depending on RCP. The number of cases will always be higher in RCP 8.5 than RCP 2.6.CONCLUSION: In the absence of changes in other factors that affect transmission (e.g., socio-economic), the impact of dams on malaria in SSA will be significantly exacerbated by climate change and increases in population. Areas without malaria transmission at present, which will transition to regions of unstable transmission, may be worst affected. Modifying conventional water management frameworks to improve malaria control, holds the potential to mitigate some of this increase and should be more actively implemented},

Surveillance methods to predict the risk of human infection are urgently needed to initiate timely preventative measures and justify the expense of implementing costly or unpopular control measures, such as aerial spraying or curfews. We quantified the links between mosquito surveillance data and the spatiotemporal patterns of 3,827 human WNV cases reported over 5 years in Colorado from 2003 to 2007. Mosquito data were strongly predictive of variation in the number of human WNV infections several weeks in advance in both a spatiotemporal statewide analysis and temporal variation within counties with substantial numbers of human cases. We outline several ways to further improve the predictive power of these data and we quantify the loss of information if no funds are available for testing mosquitoes for WNV. These results demonstrate that mosquito surveillance provides a valuable public health tool for assessing the risk of human arboviral infections, allocating limited public health resources, and justifying emergency control actions},

	Abstract = {Urban transmission of arthropod-vectored disease has increased in recent decades. Understanding and managing transmission potential in urban landscapes requires integration of sociological and ecological processes that regulate vector population dynamics, feeding behavior, and vector-pathogen interactions in these unique ecosystems. Vectorial capacity is a key metric for generating predictive understanding about transmission potential in systems with obligate vector transmission. This review evaluates how urban conditions, specifically habitat suitability and local temperature regimes, and the heterogeneity of urban landscapes can influence the biologically-relevant parameters that define vectorial capacity: vector density, survivorship, biting rate, extrinsic incubation period, and vector competence.Urban landscapes represent unique mosaics of habitat. Incidence of vector-borne disease in urban host populations is rarely, if ever, evenly distributed across an urban area. The persistence and quality of vector habitat can vary significantly across socio-economic boundaries to influence vector species composition and abundance, often generating socio-economically distinct gradients of transmission potential across neighborhoods.Urban regions often experience unique temperature regimes, broadly termed urban heat islands (UHI). Arthropod vectors are ectothermic organisms and their growth, survival, and behavior are highly sensitive to environmental temperatures. Vector response to UHI conditions is dependent on regional temperature profiles relative to the vector's thermal performance range. In temperate climates UHI can facilitate increased vector development rates while having countervailing influence on survival and feeding behavior. Understanding how urban heat island (UHI) conditions alter thermal and moisture constraints across the vector life cycle to influence transmission processes is an important direction for both empirical and modeling research.There remain persistent gaps in understanding of vital rates and drivers in mosquito-vectored disease systems, and vast holes in understanding for other arthropod vectored diseases. Empirical studies are needed to better understand the physiological constraints and socio-ecological processes that generate heterogeneity in critical transmission parameters, including vector survival and fitness. Likewise, laboratory experiments and transmission models must evaluate vector response to realistic field conditions, including variability in sociological and environmental conditions},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Landscape attributes influence spatial variations in disease risk or incidence. We present a review of the key findings from eight case studies that we conducted in Europe and West Africa on the impact of land changes on emerging or re-emerging vector-borne diseases and/or zoonoses. The case studies concern West Nile virus transmission in Senegal, tick-borne encephalitis incidence in Latvia, sandfly abundance in the French Pyrenees, Rift Valley Fever in the Ferlo (Senegal), West Nile Fever and the risk of malaria re-emergence in the Camargue, and rodent-borne Puumala hantavirus and Lyme borreliosis in Belgium.RESULTS: We identified general principles governing landscape epidemiology in these diverse disease systems and geographic regions. We formulated ten propositions that are related to landscape attributes, spatial patterns and habitat connectivity, pathways of pathogen transmission between vectors and hosts, scale issues, land use and ownership, and human behaviour associated with transmission cycles.CONCLUSIONS: A static view of the "pathogenecity" of landscapes overlays maps of the spatial distribution of vectors and their habitats, animal hosts carrying specific pathogens and their habitat, and susceptible human hosts and their land use. A more dynamic view emphasizing the spatial and temporal interactions between these agents at multiple scales is more appropriate. We also highlight the complementarity of the modelling approaches used in our case studies. Integrated analyses at the landscape scale allows a better understanding of interactions between changes in ecosystems and climate, land use and human behaviour, and the ecology of vectors and animal hosts of infectious agents},

	Abstract = {The objective of this study was to experimentally assess the effects of different climate change scenarios on the outcomes of interactions between Aedes aegypti (L.) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) (Diptera: Culicidae) larvae. The experimental design maintained a constant density of specimens while the proportion of the species in different experimental climate change scenarios varied. Our results indicate that survival of the two species was not affected, but larval development and pupation times decreased under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and high air temperature. In climate change scenarios with both species together, the survival of Ae. aegypti increased and its larval development time decreased with increasing density of Cx. quinquefasciatus. This may be attributed to the effects of intraspecific competition being more significant than interspecific competition in Ae. aegypti. Our study also reveals that climatic changes may affect the patterns of interactions between Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti. Alterations in climatic conditions changed the response of context-dependent competition, indicating the importance of studies on how ecological interactions will be affected by projected future climatic change.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Lubombo Spatial Development Initiative (LSDI) was a tri-country project between South Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique with the aim of accelerating socio-economic development in the region. The malaria component of the project was introduced to decrease the transmission of malaria in the region. This goal was met but with termination of this project resulted in an upsurge of malaria cases in the sub-region mainly as a result of migration from high transmission areas to low transmission ones. The movement of people across borders in southern Africa remains a challenge in sustaining malaria control and elimination.METHODS: Malaria case data for Swaziland and South Africa were obtained from their respective national Malaria Information Systems. Data for Mozambique was obtained from the Mozambican Ministry of Health. Data obtained during the course of the LSDI project was compared to the case data post the termination of the LSDI.RESULTS: The 12-year period of the LSDI showed a substantial decrease in disease burden amongst the three countries involved when compared to the baseline year of 2000. The decrease in malaria cases was 99 \% in South Africa and 98 \% in Swaziland. Malaria prevalence in Mozambique decreased by 85 \% over the same period. However, after the LSDI ended, between 2012 and 2014, there was an upward trend in case data that was counter to the goal of elimination.CONCLUSION: South Africa and Swaziland benefitted from the LSDI and were able to sustain malaria control and progress to the stage of elimination. Mozambique could not sustain the gains made during the LSDI and case numbers increased. Technical and financial resources are key challenges for malaria control and elimination interventions},

A research and development agenda for malaria modeling is proposed, to support operations and to enhance the broader eradication research agenda. Models are envisioned as an integral part of research, planning, and evaluation, and modelers should ideally be integrated into multidisciplinary teams to update the models iteratively, communicate their appropriate use, and serve the needs of other research scientists, public health specialists, and government officials. A competitive and collaborative framework will result in policy recommendations from multiple, independently derived models and model systems that share harmonized databases. As planned, modeling results will be produced in five priority areas: (1) strategic planning to determine where and when resources should be optimally allocated to achieve eradication; (2) management plans to minimize the evolution of drug and pesticide resistance; (3) impact assessments of new and needed tools to interrupt transmission; (4) technical feasibility assessments to determine appropriate combinations of tools, an associated set of target intervention coverage levels, and the expected timelines for achieving a set of goals in different socio-ecological settings and different health systems; and (5) operational feasibility assessments to weigh the economic costs, capital investments, and human resource capacities required},

	Abstract = {Mathematical models have been used to provide an explicit framework for understanding malaria transmission dynamics in human population for over 100 years. With the disease still thriving and threatening to be a major source of death and disability due to changed environmental and socio-economic conditions, it is necessary to make a critical assessment of the existing models, and study their evolution and efficacy in describing the host-parasite biology. In this article, starting from the basic Ross model, the key mathematical models and their underlying features, based on their specific contributions in the understanding of spread and transmission of malaria have been discussed. The first aim of this article is to develop, starting from the basic models, a hierarchical structure of a range of deterministic models of different levels of complexity. The second objective is to elaborate, using some of the representative mathematical models, the evolution of modelling strategies to describe malaria incidence by including the critical features of host-vector-parasite interactions. Emphasis is more on the evolution of the deterministic differential equation based epidemiological compartment models with a brief discussion on data based statistical models. In this comprehensive survey, the approach has been to summarize the modelling activity in this area so that it helps reach a wider range of researchers working on epidemiology, transmission, and other aspects of malaria. This may facilitate the mathematicians to further develop suitable models in this direction relevant to the present scenario, and help the biologists and public health personnel to adopt better understanding of the modelling strategies to control the disease},

	Abstract = {Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an emerging zoonotic mosquito-borne infectious disease that has been identified as a risk for spread to other continents and can cause mass livestock mortality. In equatorial Africa, outbreaks of RVF are associated with high rainfall, when vector populations are at their highest. It is, however, unclear how RVF virus persists during the inter-epidemic periods and between seasons. Understanding inter-epidemic persistence as well as the role of vectors and hosts is paramount to creating effective management programmes for RVF control. We created a mathematical model for the spread of RVF and used the model to explore different scenarios of persistence including vertical transmission and alternate wildlife hosts, with a case study on buffalo in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Our results suggest that RVF persistence is a delicate balance between numerous species of susceptible hosts, mosquito species, vertical transmission and environmental stochasticity. Further investigations should not focus on a single species, but should instead consider a myriad of susceptible host species when seeking to understand disease dynamics.},

	Abstract = {In this study, we develop a model to investigate how ecological factors might affect the dynamics of a vector-borne pathogen in a population composed by different hosts which interact with each other. Specifically, we consider the case when different host species compete with each other, as they share the same habitat, and the vector might have different feeding preference, which can also be time dependent. As a prototypical example, we apply our model to study the invasion and spread, during a typical season, of West Nile virus in an ecosystem composed of two competent avian host species and possibly of dead-end host species. We found that competition and vector feeding preferences can profoundly influence pathogen invasion, influencing its probability to start an epidemic, and influencing transmission rates. Finally, when considering time-dependent feeding preferences, as observed in the field, we noted that the virus circulation could be amplified and that the timing of epidemic peaks could be changed.

	Abstract = {Climate change is likely to change the frequency of extreme weather events, such as tropical cyclones, floods, droughts and hurricanes, and may destabilise and weaken the ecosystem services upon which human society depends. Climate change is also expected to affect animal, human and plant health via indirect pathways: it is likely that the geography of infectious diseases and pests will be altered, including the distribution of vector-borne diseases, such as Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, malaria and dengue, which are highly sensitive to climatic conditions. Extreme weather events might then create the necessary conditions for Rift Valley fever to expand its geographical range northwards and cross the Mediterranean and Arabian seas, with an unexpected impact on the animal and human health of newly affected countries. Strengthening global, regional and national early warning systems is crucial, as are co-ordinated research programmes and subsequent prevention and intervention measures.},

	Abstract = {Classical approaches to food webs focus on patterns and processes occurring at the community level rather than at the broader ecosystem scale, and often ignore spatial aspects of the dynamics. However, recent research suggests that spatial processes influence both food web and ecosystem dynamics, and has led to the idea of 'metaecosystems'. However, these processes have been tackled separately by 'food web metacommunity' ecology, which focuses on the movement of traits, and 'landscape ecosystem' ecology, which focuses on the movement of materials among ecosystems. Here, we argue that this conceptual gap must be bridged to fully understand ecosystem dynamics because many natural cases demonstrate the existence of interactions between the movements of traits and materials. This unification of concepts can be achieved under the metaecosystem framework, and we present two models that highlight how this framework yields novel insights. We then discuss patches, limiting factors and spatial explicitness as key issues to advance metaecosystem theory. We point out future avenues for research on metaecosystem theory and their potential for application to biological conservation},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although malaria disease in urban and peri-urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa is a growing concern, the epidemiologic patterns and drivers of transmission in these settings remain poorly understood. Factors associated with variation in malaria risk in urban and peri-urban areas were evaluated in this study.METHODS: A health facility-based, age and location-matched, case-control study of children 6-59 months of age was conducted in four urban and two peri-urban health facilities (HF) of Blantyre city, Malawi. Children with fever who sought care from the same HF were tested for malaria parasites by microscopy and PCR. Those testing positive or negative on both were defined as malaria cases or controls, respectively.RESULTS: A total of 187 cases and 286 controls were studied. In univariate analyses, higher level of education, possession of TV, and electricity in the house were negatively associated with malaria illness; these associations were similar in urban and peri-urban zones. Having travelled in the month before testing was strongly associated with clinical malaria, but only for participants living in the urban zones (OR = 5.1; 95\% CI = 1.62, 15.8). Use of long-lasting insecticide nets (LLINs) the previous night was not associated with protection from malaria disease in any setting. In multivariate analyses, electricity in the house, travel within the previous month, and a higher level of education were all associated with decreased odds of malaria disease. Only a limited number of Anopheles mosquitoes were found by aspiration inside the households in the peri-urban areas, and none was collected from the urban households.CONCLUSION: Travel was the main factor influencing the incidence of malaria illness among residents of urban Blantyre compared with peri-urban areas. Identification and understanding of key mobile demographic groups, their behaviours, and the pattern of parasite dispersal is critical to the design of more targeted interventions for the urban setting},

	Abstract = {Background: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an emerging vector-borne zoonotic disease that represents a threat to human health, animal health, and livestock production, particularly in Africa. The epidemiology of RVF is not well understood, so that forecasting RVF outbreaks and carrying out efficient and timely control measures remains a challenge. Various epidemiological modeling tools have been used to increase knowledge on RVF epidemiology and to inform disease management policies. Aim: This narrative review gives an overview of modeling tools used to date to measure or model RVF risk in animals, and presents how they have contributed to increasing our understanding of RVF occurrence or informed RVF surveillance and control strategies. Methodology: Systematic literature searches were performed in PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge. Additional research work was identified from other sources. Results: Literature was scarce. Research work was highly heterogeneous in methodology, level of complexity, geographic scale of approach, and geographical area of study. Gaps in knowledge and data were frequent, and uncertainty was not always explored. Spatial approaches were the most commonly utilized techniques and have been used at both local and continental scales, the latter leading to the implementation of an early warning system. Three articles using dynamic transmission models explored the potential of RVF endemicity. Risk factor studies identified water-related environmental risk factors associated with RVF occurrence in domestic livestock. Risk assessments identified importation of infected animals, contaminated products, or infected vectors as key risk pathways for the introduction of RVF virus into disease-free areas. Conclusions: Enhanced outbreak prediction and control and increased knowledge on RVF epidemiology would benefit from additional field data, continued development, and refinement of modeling techniques for exploring plausible disease transmission mechanisms and the impact of intervention strategies.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anthropogenic land use changes have contributed considerably to the rise of emerging and re-emerging mosquito-borne diseases. These diseases appear to be increasing as a result of the novel juxtapositions of habitats and species that can result in new interchanges of vectors, diseases and hosts. We studied whether the mosquito community structure varied between habitats and seasons and whether known disease vectors displayed habitat preferences in tropical Australia.METHODS: Using CDC model 512 traps, adult mosquitoes were sampled across an anthropogenic disturbance gradient of grassland, rainforest edge and rainforest interior habitats, in both the wet and dry seasons. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordinations were applied to examine major gradients in the composition of mosquito and vector communities.RESULTS: We captured {\textasciitilde}13,000 mosquitoes from 288 trap nights across four study sites. A community analysis identified 29 species from 7 genera. Even though mosquito abundance and richness were similar between the three habitats, the community composition varied significantly in response to habitat type. The mosquito community in rainforest interiors was distinctly different to the community in grasslands, whereas forest edges acted as an ecotone with shared communities from both forest interiors and grasslands. We found two community patterns that will influence disease risk at out study sites, first, that disease vectoring mosquito species occurred all year round. Secondly, that anthropogenic grasslands adjacent to rainforests may increase the probability of novel disease transmission through changes to the vector community on rainforest edges, as most disease transmitting species predominantly occurred in grasslands.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the strong influence of anthropogenic land use change on mosquito communities could have potential implications for pathogen transmission to humans and wildlife},

	Abstract = {In tropical areas, where vector insects populations are particularly numerous, temperature usually range between 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C. Considering the importance of such temperature variation in determining mosquitoes population dynamics, in this work the developmental, eclosion and survival rates of the immature stages of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) were compared under constant 25, 30 and 35 degrees C (using acclimatized chambers) and environmental (25 degrees C to 29 degrees C) temperatures. The hatching rate was considered as total number of larvae recovered after 24h. The development period as well as larval and pupal survival rate were evaluated daily. Eclosion rate was significantly higher under environmental temperature than under the studied constant temperatures, suggesting that temperature variation may be an eclosion-stimulating factor. The mean eclosion time increased with the temperature, ranging from 2.8h (25 degrees C) to 5.2h (35 degrees C). The larval period was greatly variable inside each group, although it did not differ significantly amongst groups (11.0 +/- 4.19 days), with individuals showing longer larval stages in water at 35 degrees C (12.0 4.95 days) and environmental temperature (13.6 +/- 5.98 days). Oppositely, survival was strongly affected by the higher temperature, where only one individual lived through to adult phase. The results suggest that population of Ae. albopictus from Recife may be adapting to increasing of environmental temperatures and that the limiting temperature to larval development is around 35 degrees C.},

	Abstract = {The ecology of mosquito vectors and malaria parasites affect the incidence, seasonal transmission and geographical range of malaria. Most malaria models to date assume constant or linear responses of mosquito and parasite life-history traits to temperature, predicting optimal transmission at 31 $\,^{\circ}$C. These models are at odds with field observations of transmission dating back nearly a century. We build a model with more realistic ecological assumptions about the thermal physiology of insects. Our model, which includes empirically derived nonlinear thermal responses, predicts optimal malaria transmission at 25 $\,^{\circ}$C (6 $\,^{\circ}$C lower than previous models). Moreover, the model predicts that transmission decreases dramatically at temperatures {\textgreater} 28 $\,^{\circ}$C, altering predictions about how climate change will affect malaria. A large data set on malaria transmission risk in Africa validates both the 25 $\,^{\circ}$C optimum and the decline above 28 $\,^{\circ}$C. Using these more accurate nonlinear thermal-response models will aid in understanding the effects of current and future temperature regimes on disease transmission},

Using downscaled general circulation model output, we calculate a WNV vector's response to climate change across the southern United States using process-based modeling. In the eastern United States, Culex quinquefasciatus response to projected climate change displays a latitudinal and elevational gradient. Projected summer population depressions as a result of increased immature mortality and habitat drying are most severe in the south and almost absent further north; extended spring and fall survival is ubiquitous. Much of California also exhibits a bimodal pattern. Projected onset of mosquito season is delayed in the southwestern United States because of extremely dry and hot spring and summers; however, increased temperature and late summer and fall rains extend the mosquito season. These results are unique in being a broad-scale calculation of the projected impacts of climate change on a WNV vector. The results show that, despite projected widespread future warming, the future seasonal response of C. quinquefasciatus populations across the southern United States will not be homogeneous, and will depend on specific combinations of local and regional conditions.},

Predicting the likelihood of transmission is crucial to ascertain the threat to Public and Veterinary Health. However, accurate models of West Nile Virus (WNV) expansion in Europe may be hampered by limited understanding of the population dynamics of their primary mosquito vectors and their response to environmental changes.METHODS: We used data collected in north-eastern Italy (2009-2011) to analyze the determinants of the population growth rate of the primary WNV vector Culex pipiens. A series of alternative growth models were fitted to longitudinal data on mosquito abundance to evaluate the strength of evidence for regulation by intrinsic density-dependent and/or extrinsic environmental factors. Model-averaging algorithms were then used to estimate the relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic variables in describing the variations of per-capita growth rates.RESULTS: Results indicate a much greater contribution of density-dependence in regulating vector population growth rates than of any environmental factor on its own. Analysis of an average model of Cx. pipiens growth revealed that the most significant predictors of their population dynamics was the length of daylight, estimated population size and temperature conditions in the 15 day period prior to sampling. Other extrinsic variables (including measures of precipitation, number of rainy days, and humidity) had only a minor influence on Cx. pipiens growth rates.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate the need to incorporate density dependence in combination with key environmental factors for robust prediction of Cx. pipiens population expansion and WNV transmission risk. We hypothesize that detailed analysis of the determinants of mosquito vector growth rate as conducted here can help identify when and where an increase in vector population size and associated WNV transmission risk should be expected},

	Abstract = {Temperature is a key factor influencing mosquito growth and development and is also known to affect insecticide efficacy. We evaluated the effects of larval rearing temperature and exposure to insecticides on adult mosquito fitness and competence for arboviral infection using Sindbis virus (SINV). We exposed newly hatched larvae of Aedes aegypti to an environmentally realistic level of insecticide malathion at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C and allowed the resulting adults to feed on SINV-infected blood meal. Exposure to malathion significantly reduced survival to adulthood. Statistically significant interactions between temperature and malathion were observed for body size, estimated population growth, and SINV infection and dissemination. Malathion-exposed Ae. aegypti cohorts had significantly higher population growth at 20 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. Body size decreased with higher temperature and malathion-exposed females were larger than unexposed females at 20 degrees C but not at 30 degrees C. Viral infection and dissemination increased with larval rearing temperature and were higher in malathion-exposed than unexposed females at 30 degrees C but not at 20 degrees C. These results show that environmental factors, including those factors used in controlling mosquitoes, experienced by immature stages have latent effects that continue to adulthood and alter vector competence to arboviruses.},

	Abstract = {In 2008-2009 a Rift Valley Fever (RVF) outbreak occurred in the Anjozorobe area, a temperate and mountainous area of the Madagascar highlands. The results of a serosurvey conducted in 2009 suggested recurrent circulation of RVF virus (RVFV) in this area and potential involvement of the cattle trade in RVFV circulation. The objective of this study was to describe the cattle trade network of the area and analyse the link between network structure and RVFV circulation. Five hundred and sixteen animals that tested negative in 2009 were sampled again in 2010. The 2009-2010 cattle-level seroconversion rate was estimated at 7\% (95\% CI: 5-10\%). Trade data from 386 breeders of 48 villages were collected and analysed using social network analysis methodology, nodes being villages and ties being any movements of cattle connecting villages. The specific practice of cattle barter, known as kapsile, that involves frequent contacts between cattle of two breeders, was observed in addition to usual trade. Trade data were analysed using a logistic model, the occurrence of seroconversion at the village level being the outcome variable and the network centrality measures being the predictors. A negative association was observed between the occurrence of seroconversion in the village and introduction of cattle by trade (p=0.03), as well as the distance to the nearest water point (p=0.002). Conversely, the practice of kapsile, was a seroconversion risk factor (p=0.007). The kapsile practice may be the support for inter-village RVFV circulation whereas the trade network is probably rather implicated in the introduction of RVFV to the area from other parts of Madagascar. The negative association of the distance to the nearest water point suggests that after RVFV introduction, a substantial part of transmission may be due to vectors},

In 2008-2009, a RVF outbreak occurred in a temperate and mountainous area located on the highlands of Madagascar. A three-year cattle follow-up (2009-2011) was conducted in a pilot area of this highland. A seroprevalence rate of 28\% was estimated in 2009 and a seroconversion rate of 7\% in 2009-2010. A third cross-sectional survey showed a seroconversion rate of 14\% in 2010-2011. In 2011 the longitudinal study suggested a RVFV circulation during the year. In this area where vectors density is low and cattle exchanges are linked to the virus local spread, we raise hypotheses that may explain the local persistence of the virus.},

	Abstract = {Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne zoonotic disease that causes high morbidity and mortality in ruminants. In 20082009, a RVF outbreak affected the whole Madagascar island, including the Anjozorobe district located in Madagascar highlands. An entomological survey showed the absence of Aedes among the potential RVF virus (RVFV) vector species identified in this area, and an overall low abundance of mosquitoes due to unfavorable climatic conditions during winter. No serological nor virological sign of infection was observed in wild terrestrial mammals of the area, suggesting an absence of wild RVF virus (RVFV) reservoir. However, a three years serological and virological follow-up in cattle showed a recurrent RVFV circulation. The objective of this study was to understand the key determinants of this unexpected recurrent transmission. To achieve this goal, a spatial deterministic discrete-time metapopulation model combined with cattle trade network was designed and parameterized to reproduce the local conditions using observational data collected in the area. Three scenarios that could explain the RVFV recurrent circulation in the area were analyzed: (i) RVFV overwintering thanks to a direct transmission between cattle when viraemic cows calve, vectors being absent during the winter, (ii) a low level vector-based circulation during winter thanks to a residual vector population, without direct transmission between cattle, (iii) combination of both above mentioned mechanisms. Multi-model inference methods resulted in a model incorporating both a low level RVFV winter vector-borne transmission and a direct transmission between animals when viraemic cows calve. Predictions satisfactorily reproduced field observations, 84\% of cattle infections being attributed to vector-borne transmission, and 16\% to direct transmission. These results appeared robust according to the sensitivity analysis. Interweaving between agricultural works in rice fields, seasonality of vector proliferation, and cattle exchange practices could be a key element for understanding RVFV circulation in this area of Madagascar highlands.},

@article{pepin_utility_2015,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vector control remains the primary defense against dengue fever. Its success relies on the assumption that vector density is related to disease transmission. Two operational issues include the amount by which mosquito density should be reduced to minimize transmission and the spatio-temporal allotment of resources needed to reduce mosquito density in a cost-effective manner. Recently, a novel technology, MI-Dengue, was implemented city-wide in several Brazilian cities to provide real-time mosquito surveillance data for spatial prioritization of vector control resources. We sought to understand the role of city-wide mosquito density data in predicting disease incidence in order to provide guidance for prioritization of vector control work.METHODS: We used hierarchical Bayesian regression modeling to examine the role of city-wide vector surveillance data in predicting human cases of dengue fever in space and time. We used four years of weekly surveillance data from Vitoria city, Brazil, to identify the best model structure. We tested effects of vector density, lagged case data and spatial connectivity. We investigated the generality of the best model using an additional year of data from Vitoria and two years of data from other Brazilian cities: Governador Valadares and Sete Lagoas.RESULTS: We found that city-wide, neighborhood-level averages of household vector density were a poor predictor of dengue-fever cases in the absence of accounting for interactions with human cases. Effects of city-wide spatial patterns were stronger than within-neighborhood or nearest-neighborhood effects. Readily available proxies of spatial relationships between human cases, such as economic status, population density or between-neighborhood roadway distance, did not explain spatial patterns in cases better than unweighted global effects.CONCLUSIONS: For spatial prioritization of vector controls, city-wide spatial effects should be given more weight than within-neighborhood or nearest-neighborhood connections, in order to minimize city-wide cases of dengue fever. More research is needed to determine which data could best inform city-wide connectivity. Once these data become available, MI-dengue may be even more effective if vector control is spatially prioritized by considering city-wide connectivity between cases together with information on the location of mosquito density and infected mosquitos},

@article{perkins_heterogeneity_2013,
	Abstract = {The Ross-Macdonald model has dominated theory for mosquito-borne pathogen transmission dynamics and control for over a century. The model, like many other basic population models, makes the mathematically convenient assumption that populations are well mixed; i.e., that each mosquito is equally likely to bite any vertebrate host. This assumption raises questions about the validity and utility of current theory because it is in conflict with preponderant empirical evidence that transmission is heterogeneous. Here, we propose a new dynamic framework that is realistic enough to describe biological causes of heterogeneous transmission of mosquito-borne pathogens of humans, yet tractable enough to provide a basis for developing and improving general theory. The framework is based on the ecological context of mosquito blood meals and the fine-scale movements of individual mosquitoes and human hosts that give rise to heterogeneous transmission. Using this framework, we describe pathogen dispersion in terms of individual-level analogues of two classical quantities: vectorial capacity and the basic reproductive number, R0. Importantly, this framework explicitly accounts for three key components of overall heterogeneity in transmission: heterogeneous exposure, poor mixing, and finite host numbers. Using these tools, we propose two ways of characterizing the spatial scales of transmission--pathogen dispersion kernels and the evenness of mixing across scales of aggregation--and demonstrate the consequences of a model's choice of spatial scale for epidemic dynamics and for estimation of R0, both by a priori model formulas and by inference of the force of infection from time-series data},

@article{raman_reviewing_2016,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: With a sustained national malaria incidence of fewer than one case per 1000 population at risk, in 2012 South Africa officially transitioned from controlling malaria to the ambitious goal of eliminating malaria within its borders by 2018. This review assesses the progress made in the 3 years since programme re-orientation while highlighting challenges and suggesting priorities for moving the malaria programme towards elimination.METHODS: National malaria case data and annual spray coverage data from 2010 until 2014 were assessed for trends. Information on surveillance, monitoring and evaluation systems, human and infrastructure needs and community malaria knowledge was sourced from the national programme mid-term review.RESULTS: Malaria cases increased markedly from 6811 in 2013 to 11,711 in 2014, with Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces most affected. Enhanced local transmission appeared to drive malaria transmission in Limpopo Province, while imported malaria cases accounted for the majority of cases reported in Mpumalanga Province. Despite these increases only Vhembe and Mopani districts in Limpopo Province reported malaria incidences more than one case per 1000 population at risk by 2014. Over the review period annual spray coverage did not reach the recommended target of 90 \% coverage, with information gaps identified in parasite prevalence, artemether-lumefantrine therapeutic utilization, asymptomatic/sub-patent carriage, drug efficacy, vector distribution and insecticide resistance.CONCLUSIONS: Although South Africa has made steady progress since adopting an elimination agenda, a number of challenges have been identified. The heterogeneity of malaria transmission suggests interventions in Vhembe and Mopani districts should focus on control, while in KwaZulu-Natal Province eliminating transmission foci should be prioritized. Cross-border initiatives with neighbouring countries should be established/strengthened as a matter of urgency since malaria importation poses a real threat to the country's elimination efforts. It is also critical that provincial programmes are adequately resourced to effectively conduct the necessary targeted elimination activities, informed by current vector/parasite distribution and resistance data. More sensitive methods to detect sub-patent infections, primaquine as a transmission-blocking drug, and alternative vector control methods need to be investigated. Knowledge gaps among malaria health workers and affected communities should be identified and addressed},

@article{reiner_systematic_2013,
	Abstract = {Mathematical models of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission originated in the early twentieth century to provide insights into how to most effectively combat malaria. The foundations of the Ross-Macdonald theory were established by 1970. Since then, there has been a growing interest in reducing the public health burden of mosquito-borne pathogens and an expanding use of models to guide their control. To assess how theory has changed to confront evolving public health challenges, we compiled a bibliography of 325 publications from 1970 through 2010 that included at least one mathematical model of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission and then used a 79-part questionnaire to classify each of 388 associated models according to its biological assumptions. As a composite measure to interpret the multidimensional results of our survey, we assigned a numerical value to each model that measured its similarity to 15 core assumptions of the Ross-Macdonald model. Although the analysis illustrated a growing acknowledgement of geographical, ecological and epidemiological complexities in modelling transmission, most models during the past 40 years closely resemble the Ross-Macdonald model. Modern theory would benefit from an expansion around the concepts of heterogeneous mosquito biting, poorly mixed mosquito-host encounters, spatial heterogeneity and temporal variation in the transmission process},

	Abstract = {Background: Climate change is predicted to alter the transmission of many vector-borne pathogens. The quantitative impact of climate change is usually estimated by measuring the temperature-performance relationships for a single population of vectors, and then mapping this relationship across a range of temperatures or locations. However, life history traits of different populations often differ significantly. Specifically, performance across a range of temperatures is likely to vary due to local adaptation to temperature and other factors. This variation can cause spatial variation in pathogen transmission and will influence the impact of climate change on the transmission of vector-borne pathogens. Methods: We quantified variation in life history traits for four populations of Culex pipiens (Linnaeus) mosquitoes. The populations were distributed along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients in the eastern United States that spanned similar to 3 degrees C in mean summer temperature, which is similar to the magnitude of global warming expected in the next 3-5 decades. We measured larval and adult survival, development rate, and biting rate at six temperatures between 16 and 35 degrees C, in a common garden experiment. Results: Temperature had strong and consistent non-linear effects on all four life history traits for all four populations. Adult female development time decreased monotonically with increasing temperature, with the largest decrease at cold temperatures. Daily juvenile and adult female survival also decreased with increasing temperature, but the largest decrease occurred at higher temperatures. There was significant among-population variation in the thermal response curves for the four life history traits across the four populations, with larval survival, adult survival, and development rate varying up to 45, 79, and 84 \% among populations, respectively. However, variation was not correlated with local temperatures and thus did not support the local thermal adaptation hypothesis. Conclusion: These results suggest that the impact of climate change on vector-borne disease will be more variable than previous predictions, and our data provide an estimate of this uncertainty. In addition, the variation among populations that we observed will shape the response of vectors to changing climates.},

Chemical identification of PRKs will facilitate the study of predator-prey interactions and the risk of predation, and when the prey are pests, will potentially provide environmentally friendly means of pest control. In temporary pools of the Mediterranean and Middle East, larvae of the mosquito Culiseta longiareolata Macquart are highly vulnerable to the common predatory backswimmer, Notonecta maculata Fabricius. We demonstrate that N. maculata releases two hydrocarbons, n-heneicosane and n-tricosane, which repel ovipositing females of C. longiareolata. In behavioural tests with environmentally relevant chemical concentrations in outdoor mesocosm experiments, the repellent effects of the two compounds were additive at the tested concentrations},

	Abstract = {Ronald Ross and George Macdonald are credited with developing a mathematical model of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission. A systematic historical review suggests that several mathematicians and scientists contributed to development of the Ross-Macdonald model over a period of 70 years. Ross developed two different mathematical models, Macdonald a third, and various "Ross-Macdonald" mathematical models exist. Ross-Macdonald models are best defined by a consensus set of assumptions. The mathematical model is just one part of a theory for the dynamics and control of mosquito-transmitted pathogens that also includes epidemiological and entomological concepts and metrics for measuring transmission. All the basic elements of the theory had fallen into place by the end of the Global Malaria Eradication Programme (GMEP, 1955-1969) with the concept of vectorial capacity, methods for measuring key components of transmission by mosquitoes, and a quantitative theory of vector control. The Ross-Macdonald theory has since played a central role in development of research on mosquito-borne pathogen transmission and the development of strategies for mosquito-borne disease prevention},

	Abstract = {Human mobility continues to increase in terms of volumes and reach, producing growing global connectivity. This connectivity hampers efforts to eliminate infectious diseases such as malaria through reintroductions of pathogens, and thus accounting for it becomes important in designing global, continental, regional, and national strategies. Recent works have shown that census-derived migration data provides a good proxy for internal connectivity, in terms of relative strengths of movement between administrative units, across temporal scales. To support global malaria eradication strategy efforts, here we describe the construction of an open access archive of estimated internal migration flows in endemic countries built through pooling of census microdata. These connectivity datasets, described here along with the approaches and methods used to create and validate them, are available both through the WorldPop website and the WorldPop Dataverse Repository},

@article{soti_combining_2012,
	Abstract = {Background: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne viral zoonosis of increasing global importance. RVF virus (RVFV) is transmitted either through exposure to infected animals or through bites from different species of infected mosquitoes, mainly of Aedes and Culex genera. These mosquitoes are very sensitive to environmental conditions, which may determine their presence, biology, and abundance. In East Africa, RVF outbreaks are known to be closely associated with heavy rainfall events, unlike in the semi-arid regions of West Africa where the drivers of RVF emergence remain poorly understood. The assumed importance of temporary ponds and rainfall temporal distribution therefore needs to be investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings: A hydrological model is combined with a mosquito population model to predict the abundance of the two main mosquito species (Aedes vexans and Culex poicilipes) involved in RVFV transmission in Senegal. The study area is an agropastoral zone located in the Ferlo Valley, characterized by a dense network of temporary water ponds which constitute mosquito breeding sites. The hydrological model uses daily rainfall as input to simulate variations of pond surface areas. The mosquito population model is mechanistic, considers both aquatic and adult stages and is driven by pond dynamics. Once validated using hydrological and entomological field data, the model was used to simulate the abundance dynamics of the two mosquito species over a 43-year period (1961-2003). We analysed the predicted dynamics of mosquito populations with regards to the years of main outbreaks. The results showed that the main RVF outbreaks occurred during years with simultaneous high abundances of both species. Conclusion/Significance: Our study provides for the first time a mechanistic insight on RVFV transmission in West Africa. It highlights the complementary roles of Aedes vexans and Culex poicilipes mosquitoes in virus transmission, and recommends the identification of rainfall patterns favourable for RVFV amplification.},

	Abstract = {Introduction: Dynamics of most of vector-borne diseases are strongly linked to global and local environmental changes. Landscape changes are indicators of human activities or natural processes that are likely to modify the ecology of the diseases. Here, a landscape approach developed at a local scale is proposed for extracting mosquito favourable biotopes, and for testing ecological parameters when identifying risk areas of Rift Valley fever (RVF) transmission. The study was carried out around Barkedji village, Ferlo region, Senegal. Methods: In order to test whether pond characteristics may influence the density and the dispersal behaviour of RVF vectors, and thus the spatial variation in RVFV transmission, we used a very high spatial resolution remote sensing image (2.4 m resolution) provided by the Quickbird sensor to produce a detailed land-cover map of the study area. Based on knowledge of vector and disease ecology, seven landscape attributes were defined at the pond level and computed from the land-cover map. Then, the relationships between landscape attributes and RVF serologic incidence rates in small ruminants were analyzed through a beta-binomial regression. Finally, the best statistical model according to the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small samples (AICC), was used to map areas at risk for RVF. Results: Among the derived landscape variables, the vegetation density index (VDI) computed within a 500 m buffer around ponds was positively correlated with serologic incidence (p{\textless}0.001), suggesting that the risk of RVF transmission was higher in the vicinity of ponds surrounded by a dense vegetation cover. The final risk map of RVF transmission displays a heterogeneous spatial distribution, corroborating previous findings from the same area. Conclusions: Our results highlight the potential of very high spatial resolution remote sensing data for identifying environmental risk factors and mapping RVF risk areas at a local scale.},

	Abstract = {A major challenge in disease ecology is to understand how co‐infecting parasite species interact. We manipulate in vivo resources and immunity to explain interactions between two rodent malaria parasites, Plasmodium chabaudi and P. yoelii. These species have analogous resource‐use strategies to the human parasites Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax: P. chabaudi and P. falciparum infect red blood cells (RBC) of all ages (RBC generalist); P. yoelii and P. vivax preferentially infect young RBCs (RBC specialist). We find that: (1) recent infection with the RBC generalist facilitates the RBC specialist (P. yoelii density is enhanced {\textasciitilde}10 fold). This occurs because the RBC generalist increases availability of the RBC specialist's preferred resource; (2) co‐infections with the RBC generalist and RBC specialist are highly virulent; (3) and the presence of an RBC generalist in a host population can increase the prevalence of an RBC specialist. Thus, we show that resources shape how parasite species interact and have epidemiological consequences.},

	Abstract = {Malaria is an environmentally driven disease. In order to quantify the spatial variability of malaria transmission, it is imperative to understand the interactions between environmental variables and malaria epidemiology at a micro-geographic level using a novel statistical approach. The random forest (RF) statistical learning method, a relatively new variable-importance ranking method, measures the variable importance of potentially influential parameters through the percent increase of the mean squared error. As this value increases, so does  the relative importance of the associated variable. The principal aim of this study was to create predictive malaria maps generated using the selected variables based on the RF algorithm in the Ehlanzeni District of Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. From the seven environmental variables used [temperature, lag temperature, rainfall, lag rainfall, humidity, altitude, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)], altitude was identified as the most influential predictor variable due its high selection frequency. It was selected  as the top predictor for 4 out of 12 months of the year, followed by NDVI, temperature and lag rainfall, which were each selected twice. The combination of  climatic variables that produced the highest prediction accuracy was altitude, NDVI, and temperature. This suggests that these three variables have high predictive capabilities in relation to malaria transmission. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the predictive maps generated from predictions made by the RF algorithm could be used to monitor the progression of malaria and assist in intervention and prevention efforts with respect to malaria.},

	Abstract = {South Africa, having met the World Health Organisation's pre-elimination criteria, has set a goal to achieve malaria elimination by 2018. Mpumalanga, one of three provinces where malaria transmission still occurs, has a malaria season subject to unstable transmission that is prone to sporadic outbreaks. As South Africa prepares to intensify efforts towards malaria elimination, there is a need to understand patterns in malaria transmission so that efforts may be targeted appropriately. This paper describes the seasonality of transmission by exploring the relationship between malaria cases and three potential drivers: rainfall, geography (physical location) and the source of infection (local/imported). Seasonal decomposition of the time series by Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing is applied to the case data for the geographical and source of infection sub-groups. The relationship between cases and rainfall is assessed using a cross-correlation analysis. The malaria season was found to have a short period of no/low level of reported cases and a triple peak in reported cases between September and May; the three peaks occurring in October, January and May. The seasonal pattern of locally-sourced infection mimics the triple-peak characteristic of the total series while imported infections contribute mostly to the second and third peak of the season (Christmas and Easter respectively). Geographically, Bushbuckridge municipality, which exhibits a different pattern of cases, contributed mostly to the first and second peaks in cases while Maputo province (Mozambique) experienced a similar pattern in transmission to the imported cases. Though rainfall lagged at 4 weeks was significantly correlated with malaria cases, this effect was dampened due to the growing proportion of imported cases since 2006. These findings may be useful as they enhance the understanding of the current incidence pattern and may inform mathematical models that enable one to predict the impact changes in these drivers will have on malaria transmission.},

	Abstract = {South Africa is committed to eliminating malaria with a goal of zero local transmission by 2018. Malaria elimination strategies may be unsuccessful if they focus only on vector biology, and ignore the mobility patterns of humans, particularly where the majority of infections are imported. In the first study in Mpumalanga Province in South Africa designed for this purpose, a metapopulation model is developed to assess the impact of their proposed elimination-focused policy interventions. A stochastic, non-linear, ordinary-differential equation model is fitted to malaria data from Mpumalanga and neighbouring Maputo Province in Mozambique. Further scaling-up of vector control is predicted to lead to a minimal reduction in local infections, while mass drug administration and focal screening and treatment at the Mpumalanga-Maputo border are predicted to have only a short-lived impact. Source reduction in Maputo Province is predicted to generate large reductions in local infections through stemming imported infections. The mathematical model predicts malaria elimination to be possible only when imported infections are treated before entry or eliminated at the source suggesting that a regionally focused strategy appears needed, for achieving malaria elimination in Mpumalanga and South Africa.},

@article{perkins_estimating_2015,
	Abstract = {Background Chikungunya is an emerging arbovirus that has caused explosive outbreaks in Africa and Asia for decades and invaded the Americas just over a year ago. During this ongoing invasion, it has spread to 45 countries where it has been transmitted autochthonously, infecting nearly 1.3 million people in total. Methods Here, we made use of weekly, country-level case reports to infer relationships between transmission and two putative climatic drivers: temperature and precipitation averaged across each country on a monthly basis. To do so, we used a TSIR model that enabled us to infer a parametric relationship between climatic drivers and transmission potential, and we applied a new method for incorporating a probabilistic description of the serial interval distribution into the TSIR framework. Results We found significant relationships between transmission and linear and quadratic terms for temperature and precipitation and a linear term for log incidence during the previous pathogen generation. The lattermost suggests that case numbers three to four weeks ago are largely predictive of current case numbers. This effect is quite nonlinear at the country level, however, due to an estimated mixing parameter of 0.74. Relationships between transmission and the climatic variables that we estimated were biologically plausible and in line with expectations. Conclusions Our analysis suggests that autochthonous transmission of Chikungunya in the Americas can be correlated successfully with putative climatic drivers, even at the coarse scale of countries and using long-term average climate data. Overall, this provides a preliminary suggestion that successfully forecasting the future trajectory of a Chikungunya outbreak and the receptivity of virgin areas may be possible. Our results also provide tentative estimates of timeframes and areas of greatest risk, and our extension of the TSIR model provides a novel tool for modeling vector-borne disease transmission},

@article{pascual_shifting_2008,
	Abstract = {The long-term patterns of malaria in the East African highlands typically involve not only a general upward trend in cases but also a dramatic increase in the size of epidemic outbreaks. The role of climate variability in driving epidemic cycles at interannual time scales remains controversial, in part because it has been seen as conflicting with the alternative explanation of purely endogenous cycles exclusively generated by the nonlinear dynamics of the disease. We analyse a long temporal record of monthly cases from 1970 to 2003 in a highland of western Kenya with both a time-series epidemiological model (time-series susceptible--infected--recovered) and a statistical approach specifically developed for non-stationary patterns. Results show that multiyear cycles of malaria outbreaks appear in the 1980s, concomitant with the timing of a regime shift in the dynamics of cases; the cycles become more pronounced in the 1990s, when the coupling between disease and rainfall is also stronger as the variance of rainfall increased at the frequencies of coupling. Disease dynamics and climate forcing play complementary and interacting roles at different temporal scales. Thus, these mechanisms should not be viewed as alternative and their interaction needs to be integrated in the development of future predictive models.},

@article{bhatt_effect_2015,
	Abstract = {Since the year 2000, a concerted campaign against malaria has led to unprecedented levels of intervention coverage across sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding the effect of this control effort is vital to inform future control planning. However, the effect of malaria interventions across the varied epidemiological settings of Africa remains poorly understood owing to the absence of reliable surveillance data and the simplistic approaches underlying current disease estimates. Here we link a large database of malaria field surveys with detailed reconstructions of changing intervention coverage to directly evaluate trends from 2000 to 2015, and quantify the attributable effect of malaria disease control efforts. We found that Plasmodium falciparum infection prevalence in endemic Africa halved and the incidence of clinical disease fell by 40\% between 2000 and 2015. We estimate that interventions have averted 663 (542-753 credible interval) million clinical cases since 2000. Insecticide-treated nets, the most widespread intervention, were by far the largest contributor (68\% of cases averted). Although still below target levels, current malaria interventions have substantially reduced malaria disease incidence across the continent. Increasing access to these interventions, and maintaining their effectiveness in the face of insecticide and drug resistance, should form a cornerstone of post-2015 control strategies.},

@article{shragai_zika_2017,
	Abstract = {The reemergence and growing burden of mosquito-borne virus infections have incited public fear and growing research efforts to understand the mechanisms of infection-associated health outcomes and to provide better approaches for mosquito vector control. While efforts to develop therapeutics, vaccines, and novel genetic mosquito-control technologies are underway, many important underlying ecological questions remain that could significantly enhance our understanding and ability to predict and prevent transmission. Here, we review the current knowledge about the transmission ecology of two recent arbovirus invaders, the chikungunya and Zika viruses. We introduce the viruses and mosquito vectors, highlighting viral biology, historical routes of transmission, and viral mechanisms facilitating rapid global invasion. In addition, we review factors contributing to vector global invasiveness and transmission efficiency. We conclude with a discussion of how human-induced biotic and abiotic environmental changes facilitate mosquito-borne virus transmission, emphasizing critical gaps in understanding. These knowledge gaps are tremendous; much of our data on basic mosquito ecology in the field predate 1960, and the mosquitoes themselves, as well as the world they live in, have substantially changed. A concerted investment in understanding the basic ecology of these vectors, which serve as the main drivers of pathogen transmission in both wildlife and human populations, is now more important than ever},

Remote sensing can help identify the environmental determinants of malaria transmission and their temporo-spatial evolution. Seventeen studies characterizing land cover or land use features, and relating them to malaria in the Amazon subregion, were identified. These were reviewed in order to improve the understanding of the land cover/use class roles in malaria transmission. The indicators affecting the transmission risk were summarized in terms of temporal components, landscape fragmentation and anthropic pressure.

Little is known of the epidemiology of Sindbis fever due to insufficient surveillance in most endemic countries. The epidemiological features of Sindbis fever in humans in South Africa are described here based on a retrospective study of suspected arbovirus cases submitted for laboratory investigation from 2006 to 2010. Cases were detected annually mostly during the late summer/early autumn months and an increase in cases was noted for 2010, coinciding with an outbreak of Rift Valley  fever. Cases were reported most often from the central plateau of South Africa and involved mostly males. No severe or fatal cases were reported and cases were  associated with febrile arthralgia as commonly reported for SINV infection. Further surveillance is required to reveal the true extent of the morbidity of Sindbis fever in South Africa.},

	Abstract = {Parasitic helminths are ubiquitous in most host, including human, populations. Helminths
often alter the likelihood of infection and disease progression of coinfecting
microparasitic pathogens (viruses, bacteria, protozoa), and there is great interest in
incorporating deworming into control programmes for many major diseases (e.g. HIV,
tuberculosis, malaria). However, such calls are controversial; studies show the
consequences of deworming for the severity and spread of pathogens to be highly variable.
Hence, the benefits of deworming, although clear for reducing the morbidity due to
helminth infection per se, are unclear regarding the outcome of
coinfections and comorbidities. I develop a theoretical framework to explore how helminth
coinfection with other pathogens affects host mortality and pathogen spread and evolution
under different interspecific parasite interactions. In all cases the outcomes of
coinfection are highly context-dependent, depending on the mechanism of helminth-pathogen
interaction and the quantitative level of helminth infection, with the effects of
deworming potentially switching from beneficial to detrimental depending on helminth
burden. Such context-dependency may explain some of the variation in the benefits of
deworming seen between studies, and highlights the need for obtaining a quantitative
understanding of parasite interactions across realistic helminth infection ranges.
However, despite this complexity, this framework reveals predictable patterns in the

	Abstract = {Between February 1995 and June 1999, specimens from seven aborted bison (Bison bison) fetuses or stillborn calves and their placentas, two additional placentas, three dead neonates, one 2-wk-old calf, and 35 juvenile and adult female bison from Yellowstone National Park (USA) were submitted for bacteriologic and histopathologic examination. One adult animal with a retained placenta had recently aborted. Serum samples from the 35 juvenile and adult bison were tested for Brucella spp. antibodies. Twenty-six bison, including the cow with the retained placenta, were seropositive, one was suspect, and eight were seronegative. Brucella abortus biovar 1 was isolated from three aborted fetuses and associated placentas, an additional placenta, the 2-wk-old calf, and 11 of the seropositive female bison including the animal that had recently aborted. Brucella abortus biovar 2 was isolated from one additional seropositive adult female bison. Brucella abortus was recovered from numerous tissue sites from the aborted fetuses, placentas and 2-wk-old calf. In the juvenile and adult bison, the organism was more frequently isolated from supramammary (83\%), retropharyngeal (67\%), and iliac (58\%) lymph nodes than from other tissues cultured. Cultures from the seronegative and suspect bison were negative for B. abortus. Lesions in the B. abortus-infected, aborted placentas and fetuses consisted of necropurulent placentitis and mild bronchointerstitial pneumonia. The infected 2-wk-old calf had bronchointerstitial pneumonia, focal splenic infarction, and purulent nephritis. The recently-aborting bison cow had purulent endometritis and necropurulent placentitis. Immunohistochemical staining of tissues from the culture-positive aborted fetuses, placentas, 2-wk-old calf, and recently-aborting cow disclosed large numbers of B. abortus in placental trophoblasts and exudate, and fetal and calf lung. A similar study with the same tissue collection and culture protocol was done using six seropositive cattle from a B. abortus-infected herd in July and August, 1997. Results of the bison and cattle studies were similar.},

	Abstract = {The transportation of animals to slaughterhouses is a major welfare concern. The number of slaughterhouses has decreased over time in Europe due to centralisation. This is expected to increase transport time for animals and as a consequence negatively affect animal welfare. We propose an optimisation model based on a facility location model to perform strategic analysis to improve trans- portation logistics. The model is tested on the Swedish slaughter transport system. We show that, by strategic planning and redirec- tion of transports while keeping the slaughterhouse capacities as of the original data, the potential exists to reduce transport distance by 25\% for pigs and 40\% for cattle. Furthermore, we demonstrated that approximately 50\% of Swedish slaughterhouses can be shut down with a minimal effect on total transport distances. This implies that in terms of the overall welfare picture, the decision of which animals to send where plays a far more significant role than the number of slaughterhouses. In addition, by changing relative weights on distances in the optimisation function the amount of individual transports with long journey times can be decreased. We also show results from altered slaughterhouse capacity and geographical location of slaughterhouses. This is the first time an entire country has been analysed in great detail with respect to the location, capacity and number of slaughterhouses. The focus is mainly on the analysis of unique and detailed information of actual animal transports in Sweden and a demonstration of the potential impact redirection of the transports and/or altering of slaughterhouses can have on animal welfare.},

@article{welsh_reorganizing_1997,
	Abstract = {Among alternative agriculture's basic tenets
is the notion that the long-term health of our food and fiber system depends upon maintaining sufficient diversity in production, processing, and marketing. Such diversity ensures open access, competition, and innovation. The rationale is similar to that for maintaining adequate diversity in natural biological communities - reductions in species diversity (and competition) hamper our ability to adapt to social, physical, and biological shocks through time.
This report examines the implications of two emerging and quite
different food streams in U.S. agriculture: industrial and direct marketing. Clearly, the future trajectory of these two food streams will have enormously important implications for agricultural diversity in all of its forms and manifestations.
This report represents the second installment in our ongoing
investigation of structural change in U.S. agriculture. The first report in this series, The Industrial Reorganization of Agriculture (June, 1996), provided a general overview of the basic structural changes accompanying the industrialization process. Both reports detail ongoing changes in agriculture and provide information and insight about what these changes may mean for agricultural sustainability.
The industrialized food stream is characterized by highly concentrated production and processing sectors and coordination between stages of production via vertical coordination or contractual arrangements. One
consequence of the vertical coordination and contracting is that the control over production operations by farmers and ranchers is being reduced.
Operators who sign contracts that ensure access to large industrialized
markets are usually given less latitude in selecting inputs and production
practices. During the last decade. the Wallace Institute has received
numerous inquiries about the effects of a more industrialized agriculture
on farmers and ranchers. consumers. environmental resources and the
welfare of rural communities.
Direct marketing of agricultural products is simultaneously rising
at exponential rates around the country. For example. farmers markets
have increased from less than 100 in 1960 to over 2400 in 1996. and by
almost 40 percent from 1994 to 1996. Although these direct markets
deliver a small proportion of total food supplies. they represent an
emergent trend with important implications for maintaining a diverse set
of farms. ranches and processing operations. The direct marketing stream
is characterized by direct contact between producer and consumer.
smaller-scale production operations. and a highly decentralized structure
- opposite traits to the industrialized process. Direct marketing is based
on the concept that farmers and ranchers control the products of their
operations from cultivation and weaning to final sale.
The vitality and growth of the industrial and direct marketing
food streams suggest that both will be with us for some time. Therefore it
is important to understand how these food streams are constructed. and
how they are perceived by producers. consumers and public policy
makers. Also. it is critical to conduct research to inform public policy
needed to foster development paths that incorporate all social benefits and
costs. These and other important issues and questions are addressed in
this report.},

	Abstract = {Objective-To characterize husbandry practices that could affect the risks of foreign animal disease in miniature swine. Design-Survey study. Study Population-106 owners of miniature swine. Procedures-An online survey of owners of miniature swine was conducted to obtain information about miniature pig and owner demographics; pig husbandry; movements of pigs; and pig contacts with humans, other miniature swine, and livestock. Results-12 states, 106 premises, and 317 miniature swine were represented in the survey. More than a third (35\%) of miniature swine owners also owned other livestock species. Regular contact with livestock species at other premises was reported by 13 /0 of owners. More than a third of owners visited shows or fairs (39\%) and club or association events (37\%) where miniature swine were present. More than 40\% of owners fed food waste to miniature swine. Approximately half (48\%) of the veterinarians providing health care for miniature swine were in mixed-animal practice. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results of this study indicated that miniature swine kept as pets can be exposed, directly and indirectly, to feed and other livestock, potentially introducing, establishing, or spreading a foreign animal disease such as foot-and-mouth disease. In addition, the veterinary services and carcass disposal methods used by miniature swine owners may reduce the likelihood of sick or dead pigs undergoing ante- or postmortem examination by a veterinarian.},

	Abstract = {The movements of animals were analysed under the conceptual framework of graph theory in mathematics. The swine production related premises of Denmark were considered to constitute the nodes of a network and the links were the animal movements. In this framework, each farm will have a network of other premises to which it will be linked. A premise was a farm (breeding, rearing or slaughter pig), an abattoir or a trade market. The overall network was divided in premise specific subnets that linked the other premises from and to which animals were moved. This approach allowed us to visualise and analyse the three levels of organization related to animal movements that existed in the Danish swine production registers: the movement of animals between two premises, the premise specific networks, and the industry network. The analyses of animal movements were done using these three levels of organisation. The movements of swine were studied for the period September 30, 2002 to May 22, 2003. For daily movements of swine between two slaughter pig premises, the median number of pigs moved was 130 pigs with a maximum of 3306. For movements between a slaughter pig premise and an abattoir, the median number of pigs was 24. The largest percentage of movements was from farm to abattoir (82.5\%); the median number of pigs per movement was 24 and the maximum number was 2018. For the whole period the median and maximum Euclidean distances observed in farm-to-farm movements were 22 km and 289 km respectively, while in the farm-to-abattoir movements, they were 36.2 km and 285 km. The network related to one specific premise showed that the median number of premises was mainly away from slaughter pig farms (3) or breeder farms (26) and mainly to an abattoir (1535). The assumption that animal movements can be randomly generated on the basis of farm density of the surrounding area of any farm is not correct since the patterns of animal movements have the topology of a scale-free network with a large degree of heterogeneity. This supported the opinion that the disease spread software assuming homogeneity in farm-to-farm relationship should only be used for large-scale interpretation and for epidemic preparedness. The network approach, based on graph theory, can be used efficiently to express more precisely, on a local scale (premise), the heterogeneity of animal movements. This approach, by providing network knowledge to the local veterinarian in charge of controlling disease spread, should also be evaluated as a potential tool to manage epidemics during the crisis. Geographic information systems could also be linked in the approach to produce knowledge about local transmission of disease. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {The networks generated by live animal movements are the principal vector for the propagation of infectious agents between farms, and their topology strongly affects how fast a disease may spread. The structural characteristics of networks may thus provide indicators of network vulnerability to the spread of infectious disease. This study applied social network analysis methods to describe the French swine trade network. Initial analysis involved calculating several parameters to characterize networks and then identifying high-risk subgroups of holdings for different time scales. Holding-specific centrality measurements ('degree', 'betweenness' and 'ingoing infection chain'), which summarize the place and the role of holdings in the network, were compared according to the production type. In addition, network components and communities, areas where connectedness is particularly high and could influence the speed and the extent of a disease, were identified and analysed. Dealer holdings stood out because of their high centrality values suggesting that these holdings may control the flow of animals in part of the network. Herds with growing units had higher values for degree and betweenness centrality, representing central positions for both spreading and receiving disease, whereas herds with finishing units had higher values for in-degree and ingoing infection chain centrality values and appeared more vulnerable with many contacts through live animal movements and thus at potentially higher risk for introduction of contagious diseases. This reflects the dynamics of the swine trade with downward movements along the production chain. But, the significant heterogeneity of farms with several production units did not reveal any particular type of production for targeting disease surveillance or control. Besides, no giant strong connected component was observed, the network being rather organized according to communities of small or medium size ({\textless}20\% of network size). Because of this fragmentation, the swine trade network appeared less structurally vulnerable than ruminant trade networks. This fragmentation is explained by the hierarchical structure, which thus limits the structural vulnerability of the global trade network. However, inside communities, the hierarchical structure of the swine production system would favour the spread of an infectious agent (especially if introduced in breeding herds).},

	Abstract = {Knowledge of the frequency of direct and indirect contacts between pig herds is a requirement for understanding the potential between-herd transmission of pathogens. our aim was to investigate the different contacts between Belgian pig herds. We obtained data by conducting a postal survey on 421 pig herds in August 2005 and by analysis of available information on livestock movements in the national identification-and-registration database (18-months period in 2004-2006). Direct contacts included transports of pigs by onto-farm, off-farm and between-farm movements. Indirect contacts included vehicles entering the herd and visitors entering the stables. The median number of direct contacts per herd made by onto-farm movements was 0.2/month (Q1: 0; Q3: 0.5). About 1.2\% of herds had {\textgreater}= 3 onto-farm movements/month. We used a zero-inflated negative-binomial regression model to describe differences in the number of onto-farm movements according to herd size and herd type. Piglet multipliers followed by finishing herds were predicted to have the most onto-farm movements. Farrow-to-finishing herds made less movements compared to breeding herds. A median of 3997 between-farm movements/month was made in Belgium; these mainly concerned piglets. The median number of origin herds during an 8-month period for between-farm movements was 4 (Q1: 2; Q3: 8). For a typical 1-month period, we constructed directed graphs of between-farm piglet and replacement stock movements, illustrating potential receivers and distributors of infection. Of these between-farm movements, many were made over a short distance (median straight-line distance 19 km (Q1: 8; Q3: 36)). The median number of vehicles entering a herd and visitors entering the stables was 8/ month (Q1: 6: Q3: 13) and 3/month (Q1: 2; Q3: 6) respectively. The number of indirect contacts by vehicles and persons were associated with herd size (Spearman's r: 0.7 and 0.2), herd type and other factors. Skewness of both direct and indirect contacts, illustrated that there was a wide variety in contact structure between pig herds in Belgium. Infection control might benefit by accounting for this variation in contacts and by targeting 'high-risk' herds in case of animal-disease emergencies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine farm-to-farm pig movement connections, and the usage of hauliers and abattoirs, for farms in the United Kingdom (UK), to determine the interconnectivity of the pig farm network and the implications this may have for the transmission and control of Salmonella, which was chosen as an example of an important endemic disease. Data were collected from three Quality Assurance Schemes on the use of abattoirs and livestock hauliers by commercial pig farms, and the supply of pigs to and from farms. The observed dataset had considerable variability in the number of direct (farm-to-farm) and indirect (via hauliers or abattoirs) connections between each farm over a 12-month period. The use of multiple hauliers and abattoirs by many farms resulted in considerable interconnectivity between farms due to these indirect routes. The network displayed a higher level of clustering, and short network distances between farms, than that shown by equivalent randomly generated datasets, indicating that infectious diseases might transmit quickly amongst farms but within certain clusters of farms, thus limiting the total number of farms affected. This structure and the occurrence of multiple indirect routes between many pairs of farms (via pig movements to other interconnected farms or from hauliers used by both farms), may indicate that targeting surveillance and controls on those farms with high network centrality characteristics (degree, betweenness) alone would not prove effective. Encouraging all farms within the network to reduce the number of connections might be a useful way of reducing Salmonella prevalence as it would reduce the effect of high prevalence on other farms within the network. The analysis also highlighted differences in the connections between geographical regions that were used to discuss the comparatively low Salmonella prevalence in Scotland detected by previous studies. Farms identified as belonging to large companies, as categorised by our analysis, were shown to mostly have movement connections within that company. However, small company farms had connections to farms belonging to large companies or other small companies, demonstrating that they may play an important role in creating links between large companies. The majority of farms in both Scotland and North-East and Eastern England belonged to large companies, and this finding is discussed in relation to how this may help explain the lower Salmonella seroprevalence in these areas. The study provides a first description of the characteristics of the UK pig movement network and the analysis has indicated a number of findings that might have implications for disease transmission and targeting surveillance and control.},

This study characterises pig movements throughout England and Wales between 2009 and 2013 with a view to characterising spatial and temporal patterns, network topology and trade communities. Data were extracted from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)'s RADAR (Rapid Analysis and Detection of Animal-related Risks) database, and analysed using descriptive and network approaches. A total of 61,937,855 pigs were moved through 872,493 movements of batches in England and Wales during the 5-year study period. Results show that the network exhibited scale-free and small-world topologies, indicating the potential for diseases to quickly spread within the pig industry. The findings also provide suggestions for how risk-based surveillance strategies could be optimised in the country by taking account of highly connected holdings, geographical regions and time periods with the greatest number of movements and pigs moved, as these are likely to be at higher risk for disease introduction. This study is also the first attempt to identify trade communities in the country, information which could be used to facilitate the pig trade and maintain disease-free status across the country in the event of an outbreak},

	Abstract = {Registration of cattle and pig movements is mandatory in Sweden and all registered movements between farms in the years 2006-2008 were investigated using network analysis. The networks were analysed as monthly and yearly networks, separately per species and with the two species together. Measures that have been previously discussed in relation to outbreaks and disease control were calculated; moreover a measure of the ingoing infection chain was constructed. The ingoing infection chain captures ingoing contacts through other holdings, taking the temporal aspect and sequence of the movements into account. The distribution of the contacts among the holdings was skewed. Many farms had few or no contacts, while others had many, a pattern which has also been described from other countries. The cattle network and the combined network showed a recurring seasonal pattern, while this was not seen in the pig network.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The impact of non-commercial producers on disease spread via livestock movement is related to their level of interaction with other commercial actors within the industry. Although understanding these relationships is crucial in order to identify likely routes of disease incursion and transmission prior to disease detection, there has been little research in this area due to the difficulties of capturing movements of small producers with sufficient resolution. Here, we used the Scottish Livestock Electronic Identification and Traceability (ScotEID) database to describe the movement patterns of different pig production systems which may affect the risk of disease spread within the swine industry. In particular, we focused on the role of small pig producers.RESULTS: Between January 2012 and May 2013, 23,169 batches of pigs were recorded moving animals between 2382 known unique premises. Although the majority of movements (61\%) were to a slaughterhouse, the non-commercial and the commercial sectors of the Scottish swine industry coexist, with on- and off-movement of animals occurring relatively frequently. For instance, 13\% and 4\% of non-slaughter movements from professional producers were sent to a non-assured commercial producer or to a small producer, respectively; whereas 43\% and 22\% of movements from non-assured commercial farms were sent to a professional or a small producer, respectively. We further identified differences between producer types in several animal movement characteristics which are known to increase the risk of disease spread. Particularly, the distance travelled and the use of haulage were found to be significantly different between producers.CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that commercial producers are not isolated from the non-commercial sector of the Scottish swine industry and may frequently interact, either directly or indirectly. The observed patterns in the frequency of movements, the type of producers involved, the distance travelled and the use of haulage companies provide insights into the structure of the Scottish swine industry, but also highlight different features that may increase the risk of infectious diseases spread in both Scotland and the UK. Such knowledge is critical for developing more robust biosecurity and surveillance plans and better preparing Scotland against incursions of emerging swine diseases},

	Abstract = {Understanding the complexity of live pig trade organization is a key factor to predict and control major infectious diseases, such as classical swine fever (CSF) or African swine fever (ASF). Whereas the organization of pig trade has been described in several European countries with indoor commercial production systems, little information is available on this organization in other systems, such as outdoor or small-scale systems. The objective of this study was to describe and compare the spatial and functional organization of live pig trade in different European countries and different production systems. Data on premise characteristics and pig movements between premises were collected during 2011 from Bulgaria, France, Italy, and Spain, which swine industry is representative of most of the production systems in Europe (i.e., commercial vs. small-scale and outdoor vs. indoor). Trade communities were identified in each country using the Walktrap algorithm. Several descriptive and network metrics were generated at country and community levels. Pig trade organization showed heterogeneous spatial and functional organization. Trade communities mostly composed of indoor commercial premises were identified in western France, northern Italy, northern Spain, and north-western Bulgaria. They covered large distances, overlapped in space, demonstrated both scale-free and small-world properties, with a role of trade operators and multipliers as key premises. Trade communities involving outdoor commercial premises were identified in western Spain, south-western and central France. They were more spatially clustered, demonstrated scale-free properties, with multipliers as key premises. Small-scale communities involved the majority of premises in Bulgaria and in central and Southern Italy. They were spatially clustered and had scale-free properties, with key premises usually being commercial production premises. These results indicate that a disease might spread very differently according to the production system and that key premises could be targeted to more cost-effectively control diseases. This study provides useful epidemiological information and parameters that could be used to design risk-based surveillance strategies or to more accurately model the risk of introduction or spread of devastating swine diseases, such as ASF, CSF, or foot-and-mouth disease},

	Abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine farm-to-farm pig movement connections, and the usage of hauliers and abattoirs, for farms in the United Kingdom (UK), to determine the interconnectivity of the pig farm network and the implications this may have for the transmission and control of Salmonella, which was chosen as an example of an important endemic disease. Data were collected from three Quality Assurance Schemes on the use of abattoirs and livestock hauliers by commercial pig farms, and the supply of pigs to and from farms. The observed dataset had considerable variability in the number of direct (farm-to-farm) and indirect (via hauliers or abattoirs) connections between each farm over a 12-month period. The use of multiple hauliers and abattoirs by many farms resulted in considerable interconnectivity between farms due to these indirect routes. The network displayed a higher level of clustering, and short network distances between farms, than that shown by equivalent randomly generated datasets, indicating that infectious diseases might transmit quickly amongst farms but within certain clusters of farms, thus limiting the total number of farms affected. This structure and the occurrence of multiple indirect routes between many pairs of farms (via pig movements to other interconnected farms or from hauliers used by both farms), may indicate that targeting surveillance and controls on those farms with high network centrality characteristics (degree, betweenness) alone would not prove effective. Encouraging all farms within the network to reduce the number of connections might be a useful way of reducing Salmonella prevalence as it would reduce the effect of high prevalence on other farms within the network. The analysis also highlighted differences in the connections between geographical regions that were used to discuss the comparatively low Salmonella prevalence in Scotland detected by previous studies. Farms identified as belonging to large companies, as categorised by our analysis, were shown to mostly have movement connections within that company. However, small company farms had connections to farms belonging to large companies or other small companies, demonstrating that they may play an important role in creating links between large companies. The majority of farms in both Scotland and North-East and Eastern England belonged to large companies, and this finding is discussed in relation to how this may help explain the lower Salmonella seroprevalence in these areas. The study provides a first description of the characteristics of the UK pig movement network and the analysis has indicated a number of findings that might have implications for disease transmission and targeting surveillance and control},

	Abstract = {Registration of cattle and pig movements is mandatory in Sweden and all registered movements between farms in the years 2006-2008 were investigated using network analysis. The networks were analysed as monthly and yearly networks, separately per species and with the two species together. Measures that have been previously discussed in relation to outbreaks and disease control were calculated; moreover a measure of the ingoing infection chain was constructed. The ingoing infection chain captures ingoing contacts through other holdings, taking the temporal aspect and sequence of the movements into account. The distribution of the contacts among the holdings was skewed. Many farms had few or no contacts, while others had many, a pattern which has also been described from other countries. The cattle network and the combined network showed a recurring seasonal pattern, while this was not seen in the pig network. The in-degree was not equivalent to the ingoing infection chain; there were holdings with limited direct contacts, but a large number of indirect contacts. The ingoing infection chain could be a useful measure when setting up strategies for disease control and for risk based surveillance as it identifies holdings with many contacts through live animal movements and thus at potentially higher risk for introduction of contagious diseases.

	Abstract = {Author Summary The distance and direction of adult mosquitoes movement on the landscape are important processes in the spread of mosquito-borne diseases, and are critical to understand to the development of effective intervention programs. Here we present a novel approach to study adult mosquito dispersal by using stable isotope enrichment of natural larval habitats. We apply this technique in a focal hotspot of West Nile virus (WNV) transmission in suburban, Chicago, USA to measure dispersal of Culex spp. mosquitoes. We enriched larval mosquitoes in residential catch basins using 15N-potassium nitrate and captured adult mosquitoes in traps surrounding these catch basins. Of 10,817 adult female Culex mosquitoes trapped and tested for stable isotopes, 12 individuals were enriched with 15N, indicating they originated from the catch basins receiving stable isotope amendments. The mean dispersal distance was 1.15 km and maximum flight range was 2.48 km. Ninety percent of the female Culex mosquitoes stayed within 3 km of their larval habitat, which corresponds with the distance-limited genetic variation of WNV observed in this study region. This study provides new insights on the dispersal of the most important vector of WNV in the eastern United States and demonstrates the utility of stable isotope enrichment for studying the biology of mosquitoes in other disease systems.},

	Abstract = {The dispersal patterns of mosquito vectors are important drivers of vector-borne infectious disease dynamics and understanding movement patterns is pivotal to devise successful intervention strategies. Here, we investigate the dispersal patterns of two globally important mosquito vectors, Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus, by marking naturally-occurring larvae with stable isotopes (13C or 15N). Marked individuals were captured with 32 CDC light trap, 32 gravid trap, and 16 BG Sentinel at different locations within two-kilometer radii of six larval habitats enriched with either 13C or 15N. In total, 720 trap nights from July to August 2013 yielded a total of 32,140 Cx. quinquefasciatus and 7,722 Ae. albopictus. Overall, 69 marked female mosquitoes and 24 marked male mosquitoes were captured throughout the study period. The distance that Cx. quinquefasciatus females traveled differed for host-seeking and oviposition-seeking traps, with females seeking oviposition sites traveling further than those seeking hosts. Our analysis suggests that 41\% of Cx. quinquefasciatus females that were host-seeking occurred 1-2 kilometer from their respective natal site, while 59\% remained within a kilometer of their natal site. In contrast, 59\% of Cx. quinquefasciatus females that were seeking oviposition sites occurred between 1-2 kilometer away from their larval habitat, while 15\% occurred {\textgreater} 2 kilometer away from their natal site. Our analysis estimated that approximately 100\% of Ae. albopictus females remained within 1 km of their respective natal site, with 79\% occurring within 250m. In addition, we found that male Ae. albopictus dispersed farther than females, suggesting male-biased dispersal in this Ae. albopictus population. This study provides important insights on the dispersal patterns of two globally relevant vector species, and will be important in planning next generation vector control strategies that mitigate mosquito-borne disease through sterile insect techniques, novel Wolbachia infection, and gene drive strategies},

	Abstract = {The Biogents{\textregistered} Sentinel (BGS) trap is the standard tool to monitor adult Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae), the Asian tiger mosquito. BGS traps are commonly placed in residential properties during surveillance operations, but locations within properties may have significant differences in ambient light, temperature, and humidity (e.g. between a sunlit lawn and shady underbrush). We examined the effect of BGS trap placement on Ae. albopictus capture rates in three residential properties in Monmouth County, New Jersey, USA. In each property we visually selected locations as shade, partial shade, and sun. Traps in "partial shade" locations were under vegetation and were exposed to filtered sunlight during some parts of the day while "shaded" locations were never exposed to direct sunlight. Locations defined as "sun" were exposed to direct sunlight for large parts of the day. We placed a BGS trap in each of the three location types and used small data loggers to measure temperature, relative humidity, and light exposure at each trap during a 24-hour deployment. To address temporal variability, we made seven separate measurements from 31 August to 22 September 2010. We found that "partial shade" and "full shade" locations did not differ but that "full sun" locations had significantly higher light exposure, higher temperature, and lower humidity. Importantly, Ae. albopictus catches (males, females, or both) were consistently and significantly over 3 times higher in traps located in shaded locations. To further investigate the effects of local temperature and humidity on surveillance we examined Ae. albopictus collections from 37 BGS traps fitted with data loggers and deployed weekly from August through mid October, during the 2009 season, in three urban sites in Mercer County, NJ. We confirmed that local climate influences capture rates and that Ae. albopictus surveillance projects need to monitor trap placement carefully for maximum efficiency},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: To monitor adult mosquitoes several trapping devices are available. These are differently constructed and use various mechanisms for mosquito attraction, thus resulting in different trapping sensitivities and efficacies for the various species. Mosquito monitoring and surveillance programs in Europe use various types of mosquito traps, but only a few comparisons have been conducted so far. This study compared the performance of four commercial trapping devices, which are commonly used in Europe.METHODS: Four different traps, Biogents Sentinel trap (BG trap), Heavy Duty Encephalitis Vector Survey trap (EVS trap), Centres for Disease Control miniature light trap (CDC trap) and Mosquito Magnet Patriot Mosquito trap (MM trap) were compared in a 4 × 4 latin square study. In the years 2012 and 2013, more than seventy 24-hour trap comparisons were conducted at ten different locations in northern and southern Germany, representing urban, forest and floodplain biotopes.RESULTS: Per 24-hour trapping period, the BG trap caught the widest range of mosquito species, the highest number of individuals of the genus Culex as well as the highest number of individuals of the species Ochlerotatus cantans, Aedes cinereus/geminus, Oc. communis and Culex pipiens/torrentium. The CDC trap revealed best performance for Aedes vexans, whereas the MM trap was most efficient for mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles and the species Oc. geniculatus. The EVS trap did not catch more individuals of any genus or species compared to the other three trapping devices. The BG trap caught the highest number of individuals per trapping period in urban environments as well as in wet forest, while the CDC trap caught the highest number of individuals in the floodplain biotopes. Additionally, the BG trap was most efficient for the number of mosquito species in urban locations.CONCLUSION: The BG trap showed a significantly better or similar performance compared to the CDC, EVS or MM trap with regard to trapping efficacy for most common mosquito species in Germany, including diversity of mosquito species and number of mosquitoes per trapping period. Thus, the BG trap is probably the best solution for general monitoring or surveillance programs of adult mosquitoes in Central Europe},

	Abstract = {Among 7 traps tested, significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.01) mean numbers of Aedes albopictus (269) and Aedes aegypti (55) females were collected within the Mosquito Magnet(R) Liberty trap compared with the remaining traps. The second highest mean captures for both species were obtained from omnidirectional Fay-Prince (77 Ae. albopictus) and Dragonfly(R) (13 Ae. aegypti) traps, which were not significantly different (P {\textgreater} 0.01) from an experimental moving-target trap that produced mean captures of 40 Ae. albopictus and 6 Ae. aegypti (alpha = 0.01). In terms of Ae. albopictus capture, no significant differences (P {\textgreater} 0.01) existed between Dragonfly, CDC without light (CDC -), and CDC with light (CDC +) captures, which were significantly different (P {\textless} 0.01) from Mosquito Deleto(R). No statistical significance existed between moving-target, omnidirectional, CDC +, CDC -, and Mosquito Deleto traps in terms of Ae. aegypti capture (P {\textgreater} 0.01), individual trap positions, or number of Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti females collected throughout the 21-day test (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Mosquito Magnet Liberty collected 7,208 Ae. albopictus, 1,467 Ae. aegypti, and 13 other species representing 5 genera, which comprised the largest total (9,662) and percentage (62.5\%) of mosquitoes collected by all traps combined. Omnidirectional and moving-target traps captured 1,941 and 1,050 Ae. albopictus, 138 and 220 Ae. aegypti, and 2,171 (14.0\%) and 1,397 (9.0\%) of the total mosquitoes captured by all traps, with 8 and 10 species representing 5 genera, respectively, included in these collections. The Dragonfly captured 476 Ae. albopictus, 376 Ae. aegypti, and 1,008 total specimens (6.5\%) representing 8 species and 4 genera in these collections. CDC + and CDC - traps collected nearly identical numbers of Ae. albopictus (431, 450) and Ae. aegypti (71, 71) with 537 (3.4\%) and 551 (3.5\%) total specimens, respectively. Eight species representing 5 genera were captured from CDC +, whereas CDC - captured 6 species representing 4 genera. Mosquito Deleto captured 118 mosquitoes, including 19 Ae. albopictus and 62 Ae. aegypti females (0.7\%), with 6 species representing 4 genera. Battery-powered traps with contrasting color schemes and movement worked considerably better than stationary CDC miniatures without color or movement. Omnidirectional Fay-Prince and moving-target traps without octenol captured Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti females as frequently as some commercial traps. Additionally, costs incurred per mosquito trapped, future trap design, and important consumer-centered issues are briefly discussed.},

We compared the efficacy of the BC-Sentinel trap (BGS) with and without lures (BG-lure, octenol, and CO(2)), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light trap (CDC) with and without lures, and the gravid trap (GT) for Ae. albopictus collection in two urban sites in New Jersey. The BGS with or without lures collected more Ae. albopictus compared with other trap configurations and vas more specific for Ae. albopictus. In Camden County,, the BGS with lures collected three times more Ae. albopictus than the CDC (with CO(2) only) and live times more than the GT. In Mercer County, BGS With lures collected the most mosquitoes, with 3 times more Ae. albopictus than the CDC with all lures and 50 times more than the GT. The BGS collected more male Ae. albopictus than other traps in both counties, providing further population monitoring. The GT and BGS provided a relative measure of the enzootic activity of West Nile virus in Cidex spp. and the potential epidemic activity of WNV in Ae. albopictus. The BGS provides effective chemical and visual cues for host-seeking Ae. albopictus and should be used as a part of existing surveillance programs and new initiatives targeting this mosquito.},

	Abstract = {We compared 6 adult mosquito traps for effectiveness in collecting Aedes albopictus from Suburban backyards with the goal of finding a more suitable surveillance replacement for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light trap. Trap selection included 2 commercial propane traps (Mosquito Magnet(TM) Professional trap and Mosquito Magnet Liberty trap). 2 Aedes-specific traps (Fay-Prince Omnidirectional trap and Wilton trap), I experimental trap (Mosquito Magnet-X trap), and a standard surveillance CDC light trap that served as a control. Traps that did not generate carbon dioxide were provided with bottled CO, at a flow rate of 500 ml/min. Those traps designed for use with chemical attractants (Mosquito Magnet traps) were baited with Lurex(TM) (L-lactic acid) and octenol (1-octen-3-ol) commercial baits, known attractants to Ae. albopictus. Three repetitions of a 6 X 6 Latin square test yielded a total of 37,237 mosquitoes. of which 5,280 (14.2\%) were Ae. albopictus. Significantly more (P {\textless} 0.05) Ae. albopictus were collected from the experimental and commercial traps (4,244/5,280; 80.3\%) than from the CDC light trap and Aedes-specific traps. The Mosquito Magnet Liberty collected the most Ae. albopictus (1,591), accounting for 30.1\% of the total take, followed closely by the Mosquito Magnet-X (1,468) and the Mosquito Magnet Pro (1,185). The omnidirectional Fay-Prince trap performed better than the CDC or Wilton trap. Twenty-seven mosquito species were collected during these trials, 9 species in large enough numbers for meaningful analysis. Aedes albopictus was the second most common mosquito trapped. The results of these trials indicate that propane-powered commercial traps would serve as useful substitutes in lieu of CDC traps in Ae. albopictus surveillance efforts. Trap features advantageous for collecting Ae. albopictus and other mosquito species are discussed.},

An. arabiensis seeking hosts were collected throughout the night with several peaks, often with greatest biting activity during the predawn period. Abundance did not decline linearly as a function of distance from the breeding area, but was related to vegetation patterns. Most bites occurred on the ankles or feet and decreased rapidly above that height.

@article{munhenga_evaluating_2011,
	Abstract = {Background: The successful suppression of a target insect population using the sterile insect technique (SIT) partly depends on the premise that the laboratory insects used for mass rearing are genetically compatible with the target population, that the mating competitiveness of laboratory reared males is at least comparable to that of their wild counterparts, and that mass rearing and sterilization processes do not in themselves compromise male fitness to a degree that precludes them from successfully competing for mates in the wild. This study investigated the fitness and sexual cross-compatibility between samples of field collected and laboratory reared An. arabiensis under laboratory conditions. Results: The physiological and reproductive fitness of the MALPAN laboratory strain is not substantially modified with respect to the field population at Malahlapanga. Further, a high degree of mating compatibility between MALPAN and the Malahlapanga population was established based on cross-mating experiments. Lastly, the morphological characteristics of hybrid ovarian polytene chromosomes further support the contention that the MALPAN laboratory colony and the An. arabiensis population at Malahlapanga are genetically homogenous and therefore compatible. Conclusions: It is concluded that the presence of a perennial and isolated population of An. arabiensis at Malahlapanga presents a unique opportunity for assessing the feasibility of SIT as a malaria vector control option. The MALPAN laboratory colony has retained sufficient enough measures of reproductive and physiological fitness to present as a suitable candidate for male sterilization, mass rearing and subsequent mass release of sterile males at Malahlapanga in order to further assess the feasibility of SIT in a field setting.},

@article{muturi_environmental_2008,
	Abstract = {Studies were conducted between May and June, 2006 to investigate the environmental factors affecting the distribution of An. arabiensis Patton and Culex quinquefasciatus Say in Mwea, Kenya. The sampling unit comprised all non-paddy aquatic habitats and ten randomly selected paddies and canals located within a 200 m radius from the periphery of the study site. Thirteen physico-chemical variables were recorded for each sampling site in each sampling occasion and a sample of mosquito larvae and other aquatic invertebrates collected. The non-paddy aquatic habitats identified included pools and marshes. Morphological identification of 1,974 mosquito larvae yielded four species dominated by Cx. quinquefasciatus (73.2\%) and An. arabiensis (25.0\%). Pools were associated with significantly higher Cx. quinquefasciatus larval abundance and less diversity of other aquatic invertebrates compared with other habitat types. In contrast, the abundance of An. arabiensis did not differ significantly among habitat types. Culex quinquefasciatus habitats had higher water conductivity and exhibited a higher abundance of other aquatic invertebrates than An. arabiensis habitats. Chi-square analysis indicated that the two species were more likely to coexist in the same habitats than would be expected by chance alone. Anopheles arabiensis larvae were positively associated with dissolved oxygen and adults of family Haliphdae and negatively associated with emergent vegetation and Heptageniidae larvae. Culex quinquefasciatus larvae were positively associated with dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, Chironomidae larvae, and Microvelidae adults and negatively associated with emergent vegetation. These findings suggest that both biotic and abiotic factors play a significant role in niche partitioning among Cx. quinquefasciatus and An. arabiensis, a factor that should be considered when designing an integrated vector control program.},

@article{munhenga_field_2014,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the ecology and behaviour of a target species is a prerequisite for the successful development of any vector control strategy. Before the implementation of any strategy it is essential to have comprehensive information on the bionomics of species in the targeted area. The aims of this study were to conduct regular entomological surveillance and to determine the relative abundance of anopheline species in the northern Kruger National Park. In addition to this, the impact of weather conditions on an Anopheles arabiensis population were evaluated and a range of mosquito collection methods were assessed. METHODS: A survey of Anopheles species was made between July 2010 and December 2012. Mosquitoes were collected from five sites in the northern Kruger National Park, using carbon dioxide-baited traps, human landing and larval collections. Specimens were identified morphologically and polymerase chain reaction assays were subsequently used where appropriate. RESULTS: A total of 3,311 specimens belonging to nine different taxa was collected. Species collected were: Anopheles arabiensis (n=1,352), Anopheles quadriannulatus (n=870), Anopheles coustani (n=395), Anopheles merus (n=349), Anopheles pretoriensis (n=35), Anopheles maculipalpis (n=28), Anopheles rivulorum (n=19), Anopheles squamosus (n=3) and Anopheles rufipes (n=2). Members of the Anopheles gambiae species complex were the most abundant and widely distributed, occurring across all collection sites. The highest number of mosquitoes was collected using CO2 baited net traps (58.2\%) followed by human landing catches (24.8\%). Larval collections (17\%) provided an additional method to increase sample size. Mosquito sampling productivity was influenced by prevailing weather conditions and overall population densities fluctuated with seasons. CONCLUSION: Several anopheline species occur in the northern Kruger National Park and their densities fluctuate between seasons. Species abundance and relative proportions within the An. gambiae complex varied between collection methods. There is a perennial presence of an isolated population of An. arabiensis at the Malahlapanga site which declined in density during the dry winter months, making this site suitable for a small pilot study site for Sterile Insect Technique as a malaria vector control strategy},

	Abstract = {Understanding contact networks are important for modelling and managing the spread and control of communicable diseases in populations. This study characterizes the swine shipment network of a multi-site production system in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Data were extracted from a company's database listing swine shipments among 251 swine farms, including 20 sow, 69 nursery and 162 finishing farms, for the 2-year period of 2006 to 2007. Several network metrics were generated. The number of shipments per week between pairs of farms ranged from 1 to 6. The medians (and ranges) of out-degree were: sow 6 (1-21), nursery 8(0-25), and finishing 0(0-4), over the entire 2-year study period. Corresponding estimates for in-degree of nursery and finishing farms were 3 (0-9) and 3 (0-12) respectively. Outgoing and incoming infection chains (OIC and IIC), were also measured. The medians (ranges) of the monthly OIC and IIC were 0 (0-8) and 0 (0-6), respectively, with very similar measures observed for 2-week intervals. Nursery farms exhibited high measures of centrality. This indicates that they pose greater risks of disease spread in the network. Therefore, they should be given a high priority for disease prevention and control measures affecting all age groups alike. The network demonstrated scale-free and small-world topologies as observed in other livestock shipment studies. This heterogeneity in contacts among farm types and network topologies should be incorporated in simulation models to improve their validity. In conclusion, this study provided useful epidemiological information and parameters for the control and modelling of disease spread among swine farms, for the first time from Ontario, Canada.

	Abstract = {In networks, nodes may preferentially contact other nodes with similar (assortatively mixed) or dissimilar (disassortatively mixed) numbers of contacts. Different patterns of contact support different epidemic dynamics, potentially affecting the efficacy of control measures such as contact tracing, which aims to identify and isolate nodes with infectious contacts. We used stochastic simulations to investigate the effects of mixing patterns on epidemic dynamics and contact-tracing efficacy. For uncontrolled epidemics, outbreaks occur at lower infection rates for more assortatively mixed networks, with faster initial epidemic growth rate and shorter epidemic duration than for disassortatively mixed networks. Contact tracing performs better for assortative mixing where epidemic size is large and tracing rate low, but it performs better for disassortative mixing at higher contact rates. For assortatively mixed networks, disease spreads first to highly connected nodes, but this is balanced by contact tracing quickly identifying these same nodes. The converse is true for disassortative mixing, where both disease and tracing are less likely to target highly connected nodes. For small epidemics, contact tracing is more effective on disassortative networks due to the greater resilience of assortative networks to link removal. Multi-step contact tracing is more effective than single-step tracing for assortative mixing, but this effect is smaller for disassortatively mixed networks.},

	Abstract = {Transport of live animals is a major risk factor in the spread of infectious diseases between holdings. The present study analysed the pork supply chain of a producer community in Northern Germany. The structure of trade networks can be characterised by carrying out a network analysis. To identify holdings with a central position in this directed network of pig production, several parameters describing these properties were measured (in-degree, out-degree, ingoing and outgoing infection chain, betweenness centrality and ingoing and outgoing closeness centrality). To obtain the importance of the different holding types (multiplier, farrowing farms, finishing farms and farrow-to-finishing farms) within the pyramidal structure of the pork supply chain, centrality parameters were calculated for the entire network as well as for the individual holding types. Using these centrality parameters, two types of holdings could be identified. In the network studied, finishing and farrow-to-finishing farms were more likely to be infected due to the high number of ingoing trade contacts. Due to the high number of outgoing trade contacts multipliers and farrowing farms had an increased risk to spread a disease to other holdings. However, the results of the centrality parameters degree and infection chain were not always consistent, such that the indirect trade contacts should be taken into consideration to understand the real importance of a holding in spreading or contracting an infection. Furthermore, all calculated parameters showed a highly right-skewed distribution. Networks with such a degree distribution are considered to be highly resistant concerning the random removal of nodes. But by strategic removal of the most central holdings, e.g. by trade restrictions or selective vaccination or culling, the network structure can be changed efficiently and thus decompose into fragments. Such a fragmentation of the trade networks is of particular importance from an epidemiological perspective. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Direct and indirect contacts among animal holdings are important in the spread of infectious diseases. The objectives of this study were to describe networks of pig movements and the sharing of trucks used for those movements between swine farms in four Canadian regions using network analysis tools and to obtain contact parameters for infectious disease spread simulation models. Four months of swine movement data from a pilot pig traceability programme were used. Two types of networks were created using three time scales (weekly, monthly and the full study period): one-mode networks of farm-to-farm direct contact representing animal shipments and two-mode networks representing the sharing of trucks between farms. Contact patterns among farms were described by estimating a range of relevant network measures. The overall network neglecting the four regions consisted of 145 farms, which were connected by 261 distinct links. A total of 184 trucks were used to transport 2043 shipments of pigs during the study period. The median in-and out-degree for the overall one-mode network was 1 and ranged from 0 to 26 and 0 to 10, respectively. The overall one-mode network had heterogeneous degree distribution, a high clustering coefficient and shorter average path length than would be expected for randomly generated networks of similar size. On average one truck was shared by four farms in the overall network, or by three farms when considered the monthly and weekly networks. Degree distribution of the two-mode overall network demonstrated characteristics of power-law distribution. For more than 50\% of shipments on any given day, the same truck was used for at least one other shipment. Findings from this study are in agreement with previous work, which suggested that swine movement networks exhibit small-world and scale-free topologies. Furthermore, trucks used for the shipment of pigs can play an important role in connecting otherwise unconnected farms and may increase the spread of disease.},

	Abstract = {Aggregated movement data do not take into account the relative position of the units within a higher-level structure. Social network analysis (SNA) and graph theory provide a tool to organise and analyse relational data overcoming the limitations of standard methods where the position of individuals/observations does not affect the result of the analysis. Some recorded movements of cattle and sheep during the initial phase of the 2001 foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in the UK, before the ban on animal movements was imposed, are analysed descriptively using SNA. With the data available, a directed dichotomized network with 653 nodes and 797 arches was analysed. Most of the 10 nodes with the highest betweenness (3 farms, 4 markets and 3 dealers) were identified as key players in the initial spread of the infection. Three groups of nodes with distinctive proportion of k {\textless} or = 2 neighbours would result in three different theoretical outbreak dimensions assuming that the infection is only disseminated by the movements included in the network: no spread, spread up to 7\% and around 25\%. There are three hierarchical clusters with 308, 215 and 130 nodes, respectively. Farms in cluster 1 appear to be more similar in their movement patterns to non-farm holdings than to farms in clusters 2 and 3. Relative betweenness, k-neighbours and structural equivalence using hierarchical clustering were able to identify key actors in the evolution of the initial phases of the FMD outbreak such as markets, dealers and farms with atypical movement patterns. Holdings with high betweenness, large number of k {\textless} or = 2 neighbours and with movement pattern as in cluster 1 should be targeted in disease control activities once primary actors like markets, dealers and slaughter houses have been contained},

	Abstract = {Following the foot and mouth disease epidemic in Great Britain (GB) in 2001, livestock movement bans were replaced with mandatory periods of standstill for livestock moving between premises. It was anticipated that these movement restrictions would limit each individual's contact networks, the extent of livestock movements and thus the spread of future disease outbreaks. However, the effect of behaviour changes on the global network in adapting to these restrictions is currently unknown. Here, we take a novel approach using GB cattle movement data to construct week-by-week contact networks between animal holdings (AH) to explore the evolution of the network since this policy was introduced, the first time network theory has been used for this purpose. We show that the number of AH moving cattle as part of the giant strong component (GSC), representing the region of maximal connectivity, has been increasing linearly over time. This is of epidemiological significance as the size of the GSC indicates the number of holdings potentially exposed to disease, thus giving a lower bound of maximum epidemic size. Therefore, despite restriction of cattle movements, emergent behaviour in this self-organizing system has potentially increased the size of infectious disease epidemics within the cattle industry},

	Abstract = {Accuracy of results from mathematical and computer models of biological systems is often complicated by the presence of uncertainties in experimental data that are used to estimate parameter values. Current mathematical modeling approaches typically use either single-parameter or local sensitivity analyses. However, these methods do not accurately assess uncertainty and sensitivity in the system as, by default, they hold all other parameters fixed at baseline values. Using techniques described within we demonstrate how a multi-dimensional parameter space can be studied globally so all uncertainties can be identified. Further, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques can help to identify and ultimately control uncertainties. In this work we develop methods for applying existing analytical tools to perform analyses on a variety of mathematical and computer models. We compare two specific types of global sensitivity analysis indexes that have proven to be among the most robust and efficient. Through familiar and new examples of mathematical and computer models, we provide a complete methodology for performing these analyses, in both deterministic and stochastic settings, and propose novel techniques to handle problems encountered during these types of analyses},

While livestock movement data are readily available in the UK and other countries in the EU, in many countries around the world, such detailed data are not available. By using a comprehensive database of the UK cattle trade network, we implement various sampling strategies to determine the quantity of network data required to give accurate epidemiological predictions. It is found that by targeting nodes with the highest number of movements, accurate predictions on the size and spatial spread of epidemics can be made.

@article{bengis_role_2004,
	Abstract = {There are huge numbers of wild animals distributed throughout the world and the diversity of wildlife species is immense. Each landscape and habitat has a kaleidoscope of niches supporting an enormous variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species, and each species or taxon supports an even more impressive  array of macro- and micro-parasites. Infectious pathogens that originate in wild  animals have become increasingly important throughout the world in recent decades, as they have had substantial impacts on human health, agricultural production, wildlife-based economies and wildlife conservation. The emergence of  these pathogens as significant health issues is associated with a range of causal factors, most of them linked to the sharp and exponential rise of global human activity. Among these causal factors are the burgeoning human population, the increased frequency and speed of local and international travel, the increase in  human-assisted movement of animals and animal products, changing agricultural practices that favour the transfer of pathogens between wild and domestic animals, and a range of environmental changes that alter the distribution of wild hosts and vectors and thus facilitate the transmission of infectious agents. Two  different patterns of transmission of pathogens from wild animals to humans are evident among these emerging zoonotic diseases. In one pattern, actual transmission of the pathogen to humans is a rare event but, once it has occurred, human-to-human transmission maintains the infection for some period of time or permanently. Some examples of pathogens with this pattern of transmission are human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, influenza A, Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome. In the second pattern, direct  or vector-mediated animal-to-human transmission is the usual source of human infection. Wild animal populations are the principal reservoirs of the pathogen and human-to-human disease transmission is rare. Examples of pathogens with this  pattern of transmission include rabies and other lyssaviruses, Nipah virus, West  Nile virus, Hantavirus, and the agents of Lyme borreliosis, plague, tularemia, leptospirosis and ehrlichiosis. These zoonotic diseases from wild animal sources  all have trends that are rising sharply upwards. In this paper, the authors discuss the causal factors associated with the emergence or re-emergence of these zoonoses, and highlight a selection to provide a composite view of their range, variety and origins. However, most of these diseases are covered in more detail in dedicated papers elsewhere in this Review.},

	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) causes morbidity and mortality in a range of animals and threatens local economies by acting as a barrier to international trade. The outbreak in the United Kingdom in 2001 that cost billions to control highlighted the risk that the pathogen poses to agriculture. In response, several mathematical models have been developed to parameterize and predict both transmission dynamics and optimal disease control. However, a lack of understanding of the multi-strain etiology prevents characterization of multi-strain dynamics. Here, we use data from FMDV serology in an endemic setting to probe strain-specific transmission and immunodynamics. Five serotypes of FMDV affect cattle in the Far North Region of Cameroon. We fit both catalytic and reverse catalytic models to serological data to estimate the force of infection and the rate of waning immunity, and to detect periods of sustained transmission. For serotypes SAT2, SAT3, and type A, a model assuming life-long immunity fit better. For serotypes SAT1 and type O, the better-fit model suggests that immunity may wane over time. Our analysis further indicates that type O has the greatest force of infection and the longest duration of immunity. Estimates for the force of infection were time-varying and indicated that serotypes SAT1 and O displayed endemic dynamics, serotype A displayed epidemic dynamics, and SAT2 and SAT3 did not sustain local chains of transmission. Since these results were obtained from the same population at the same time, they highlight important differences in transmission specific to each serotype. They also show that immunity wanes at rates specific to each serotype, which influences patterns of local persistence. Overall, this work shows that viral serotypes can differ significantly in their epidemiological and immunological characteristics. Patterns and processes that drive transmission in endemic settings must consider complex viral dynamics for accurate representation and interpretation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	Abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) threatens animal health and leads to considerable economic losses worldwide. Progress towards minimizing both veterinary and financial impact of the disease will be made with targeted disease control policies. To move towards targeted control, specific targets and detailed control strategies must be defined. One approach for identifying targets is to use mathematical and simulation models quantified with accurate and fine-scale data to design and evaluate alternative control policies. Nevertheless, published models of FMDV vary in modelling techniques and resolution of data incorporated. In order to determine which models and data sources contain enough detail to represent realistic control policy alternatives, we performed a systematic literature review of all FMDV dynamical models that use host data, disease data or both data types. For the purpose of evaluating modelling methodology, we classified models by control strategy represented, resolution of models and data, and location modelled. We found that modelling methodology has been well developed to the point where multiple methods are available to represent detailed and contact-specific transmission and targeted control. However, detailed host and disease data needed to quantify these models are only available from a few outbreaks. To address existing challenges in data collection, novel data sources should be considered and integrated into models of FMDV transmission and control. We suggest modelling multiple endemic areas to advance local control and global control and better understand FMDV transmission dynamics. With incorporation of additional data, models can assist with both the design of targeted control and identification of transmission drivers across geographic boundaries},

@article{miguel_contacts_2013-1,
	Abstract = {Wildlife is a maintenance host for several significant livestock diseases. Interspecific pathogen transmission may occur in complex socio-ecological systems at wild-domestic interfaces that have so far been seldom studied. We investigated the relationship between the dynamics of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in vaccinated and unvaccinated cattle populations with respect to frequency of contacts with African buffalo at different buffalo-cattle interfaces. A total of 36 GPS collars were deployed on African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and cattle (Bos taurus, Bos indicus) to assess contact patterns at the periphery of 3 protected areas in Zimbabwe. Simultaneously, a longitudinal survey of 300 cattle with five repeated sampling sessions on known individuals during 16 months was undertaken. Immunological assays (ELISAs), that allowed tracking the production of antibodies following infection or vaccination, were used to assess serological transitions (i.e., incidence and reversion) in the surveyed cattle. Variation in rates of serological transitions across seasons, sites and as a function of the frequency of contact with buffalo was analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. The incidence in the cattle populations of FMD antibodies produced following infection varied among sites and as a function of contact rates with African buffalo. The incidence was higher for sites with higher contact rates between the two species. The serological incidence was also related to seasons, being higher during the dry or rainy seasons depending on sites. The reversion rate pattern was the opposite of this incidence rate pattern. Vaccination seemed partly efficient at the individual level, but it did not prevent the diffusion of FMD viruses from the wild reservoir host to the domestic cattle population. Furthermore, antibodies were detected in areas where cattle had not been vaccinated, suggesting that the virus may have spread without being detected in domestic populations. Access to resources shared by buffalo and livestock, particularly water and grazing areas during the dry season, could partly explain the observed patterns of FMD transmission. We discuss how insights on ecological processes leading to wildlife-livestock contacts may provide some innovative solutions to improve FMD management, including surveillance, prevention or control of buffalo-borne outbreaks, by adopting strategies targeting risky areas and periods.},

	Abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) endemic regions contain three-quarters of the world's FMD susceptible livestock and most of the world's poor livestock keepers. Yet FMD impact on smallholders in these regions is poorly understood. Diseases of low mortality can exert a large impact if incidence is high. Modelling and field studies commonly find high FMD incidence in endemic countries. Sero-surveys typically find a third of young cattle are sero-positive, however, the proportion of sero-positive animals that developed disease, and resulting impact, are unknown. The few smallholder FMD impact studies that have been performed assessed different aspects of impact, using different approaches. They find that FMD impact can be high ({\textgreater}10\% of annual household income). However, impact is highly variable, being a function of FMD incidence and dependency on activities affected by FMD. FMD restricts investment in productive but less FMD-resilient farming methods, however, other barriers to efficient production may exist, reducing the benefits of FMD control. Applying control measures is costly and can have wide-reaching negative impacts; veterinary-cordon-fences may damage wildlife populations, and livestock movement restrictions and trade bans damage farmer profits and the wider economy. When control measures are ineffective, farmers, society and wildlife may experience the burden of control without reducing disease burden. Foot-and-mouth disease control has benefitted smallholders in South America and elsewhere. Success takes decades of regional cooperation with effective veterinary services and widespread farmer participation. However, both the likelihood of success and the full cost of control measures must be considered. Controlling FMD in smallholder systems is challenging, particularly when movement restrictions are hard to enforce. In parts of Africa this is compounded by endemically infected wildlife and limited vaccine performance. This paper reviews FMD impact on smallholders in endemic countries. Significant evidence gaps exist and guidance on the design of FMD impact studies is provided},

	Abstract = {In Africa, for the control of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), more information is needed on the spread of the disease at local, regional and inter-regional level. The aim of this review is to identify the role that animal husbandry, trade and wildlife have on the transmission of FMD and to provide a scientific basis for different FMD control measures in Africa. Review of literature, published reports and databases shows that there is more long distance spread of FMD virus serotypes within North, West, Central and East Africa than in southern Africa. In North, West, Central and East Africa migratory animal husbandry systems often related with search for grazing and water as well as trade are practiced to a greater extent than in southern Africa. In southern Africa, the role of African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is more extensively studied than in the other parts of Africa, but based on the densities of African buffalo in Central and East Africa, one would assume that buffalo should also play a role in the epidemiology of FMD in this part of Africa. More sampling of buffalo is necessary in West, Central and East Africa. The genetic analysis of virus strains has proven to be valuable to increase our understanding in the spread of FMD in Africa. This review shows that there is a difference in FMD occurrence between southern Africa and the rest of the continent; this distinction is most likely based on differences in animal husbandry and trade systems. Insufficient data on FMD in wildlife outside southern Africa is limiting our understanding on the role wildlife plays in the transmission of FMD in the other buffalo inhabited areas of Africa.},

SAT 3 has only been isolated in a few cases and only in African buffalos (Syncerus caffer). To investigate the presence of antibodies against FMDV serotypes in wildlife in Uganda, serological studies were performed on buffalo serum samples collected between 2001 and 2003. Thirty-eight samples from African buffalos collected from Lake Mburo, Kidepo Valley, Murchison Falls and Queen Elizabeth National Parks were screened using Ceditest{\textregistered} FMDV NS to detect antibodies against FMDV non-structural proteins (NSP). The seroprevalence of antibodies against non-structural proteins was 74\%. To characterize FMDV antibodies, samples were selected and titrated using serotype-specific solid phase blocking enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISAs). High titres of antibodies (≥1 : 160) against FMDV serotypes SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3 were identified. This study suggests that African buffalos in the different national parks in Uganda may play an important role in the epidemiology of SAT serotypes of FMDV.},

	Abstract = {The notion of a critical community size (CCS), or population size that is likely to result in long-term persistence of a communicable disease, has been developed based on the empirical observations of acute immunizing infections in human populations, and extended for use in wildlife populations. Seasonal birth pulses are frequently observed in wildlife and are expected to impact infection dynamics, yet their effect on pathogen persistence and CCS have not been considered. To investigate this issue theoretically, we use stochastic epidemiological models to ask how host life-history traits and infection parameters interact to determine pathogen persistence within a closed population. We fit seasonal birth pulse models to data from diverse mammalian species in order to identify realistic parameter ranges. When varying the synchrony of the birth pulse with all other parameters being constant, our model predicted that the CCS can vary by more than two orders of magnitude. Tighter birth pulses tended to drive pathogen extinction by creating large amplitude oscillations in prevalence, especially with high demographic turnover and short infectious periods. Parameters affecting the relative timing of the epidemic and birth pulse peaks determined the intensity and direction of the effect of pre-existing immunity in the population on the pathogen's ability to persist beyond the initial epidemic following its introduction},

@article{sumption_incidence_2008,
	Abstract = {Risk assessment procedures frequently require quantitative data on the prevalence of the disease in question. Although most countries are members of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the importance attached to foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) reporting or surveillance for infection varies enormously between infected countries. There is a general consensus that FMD outbreaks in endemic countries are greatly under-reported, to a degree related either to the economic or the political development level of the country. This exploratory study was first undertaken by FAO, but thereafter extended and reviewed by the working group on FMD risk co-ordinated by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The paper attempts to overcome the lack of reporting through using expert opinion to extrapolate incidence indices from countries considered to have 'representative' levels of FMD. These were combined with livestock density distributions to provide maps of prevalence indices, which were found to be highest in China (pigs), India (cattle), the Near East (small ruminants) and the Sahel (small ruminants and cattle). Similar patterns were found when weighted expert rankings of a range of additional ranked disease parameters were also produced, and then combined with susceptible animal densities to produce a weighted multi-species density. Results suggest that the methods can provide useful information at both national and sub-national resolution, even for countries for which quantitative FMD data is currently unavailable: two of the regions identified provide little or no data on a regular basis to the OIE and therefore may be overlooked if the level of officially reported FMD is only used. As the estimated prevalences are based on recent disease history and expert opinion, they are most likely to be inaccurate where FMD incursions are infrequent as a result of the preventive measures and geographical and trade isolation. This study, therefore, highlights the need for specific detailed country risk assessments where livestock trade is under consideration. Validating the approach including ground truthing, will require collaboration between a number of agencies and institutions, in critical countries, particularly those with high disease burdens that share borders or trade livestock with currently FMD-free nations},
