The inset figure shows the distribution of ages in our sample, which best cover buffalo between two and eight years old and include 796 samples from 151 repeatedly captured individuals. Ages are binned for visualization and animals that test positive are assumed to remain positive for the duration of the study. Sample sizes for TB- are: 10, 182, 209, 103, 27, 35 buffalo. Sample sizes for TB+ animals are: 0, 21, 108, 75, 21, 1 for ages 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10, and 10+ respectively.}}{2}}

Hosts are represented as Susceptible (S), infected with TB only (IT), infected with brucellosis only (IB), co-infected with both infections (IC), persistently infected with brucellosis only but no longer infectious (RB), and persistently infected with brucellosis and co-infected with BTB (RC). (left) A detailed cohort study informs model parameterization, including the mortality, transmission, and fecundity consequences of co-infection as well as the (right) transmission parameters for both infections. The prevalence plot illustrates that the model accurately reproduces the observed co-infection patterns in the data. Bars represent model results and dots represent the data.}}{3}}
