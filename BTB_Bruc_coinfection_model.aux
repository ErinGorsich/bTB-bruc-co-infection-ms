The inset figure shows the distribution of ages in our sample, which best cover buffalo between two and eight years old and include 796 samples from 151 repeatedly captured individuals. Ages are binned for visualization and animals that test positive are assumed to remain positive for the duration of the study. Sample sizes for TB- are: 10, 182, 209, 103, 27, 35 buffalo. Sample sizes for TB+ animals are: 0, 21, 108, 75, 21, 1 for ages 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10, and 10+ respectively.}}{2}}
